# (Content based) Recommender System using TED talks
**Group name**: September-2023-Group-001<br>
- Mentees:
    - Sherin Anthony
    - Raluca Nicoara
- Mentor: Jennifer Loftus 
    
## Summary

## Selection reasoning
1. Mutual interest in NLP methods and projects
2. TED talks as a source for NLP: 
  - rich data by covering a wide range of topics, languages, and speakers. The transcripts, subtitles, and metadata that can be used for various NLP tasks (e.g. sentiment analysis, summarization)
  - valuable resource for learning and education by offering insights from experts and innovators across different fields.
  - platform for social change so analyzing TED talks we can understand the trends, themes, and emotions that drive these ideas, and how they resonate with different audiences and cultures

## Work strategy
- Weekly team check-ins organized by our mentor, Jennifer. During these calls, we would present the progress, discuss issues and setup tasks to do until the following week
- The aim was to learn by doing so each of us attempted to do the tasks and shared our experiences and progress during the weekly catch-ups.
  
## Issues experienced
1. *No recent dataset available and no up-to-date working data colllecting tool/scraper available* <br>
   -> building our own webscraper that collects data based on topics and downloads each talk into a separate json file
2. *Nested json files with uneven structure* <br>
   -> developing functions to normalize the json structure and flatten all levels of nesting
3. Low memory and long time processing for the NLP steps due to high volume of data 

## Final Results

## Possible Next Steps
- Continue working on the project by exploring new content based recommender techniques
- Developing the webscraper into a Python library
