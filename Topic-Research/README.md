# NLP â€“ recommender systems - background research

## Potential topics
1. __Ted Talks__ - transcripts of talks and metadata (e.g.  title, speaker, description, tags, ratings, views, and date of the talks) to  extract the key points, themes, and insights -> build a recommended system that suggests suitable and inspiring talks based on sentiments,interest or goals. We could use an existing dataset form Kaggle or use an webscraper (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/miguelcorraljr/ted-talks-2022)
2. __Stack Exchange/Overflow__ - build a recommender system that uses NLP to match users with relevant questions and answers based on their interests, expertise, and feedback. The dataset contains questions, answers, comments, votes, timestamps of the posts. Examples: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aneeshtickoo/data-science-stack-exchange?select=Comments.xml, https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stackoverflow/statsquestions)
3. __Music__ - sentiment based recommendation (e.g. https://www.scielo.org.mx/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1405-55462023000100053 )
4. __Jobs__:
	* Disertation from Dublin Business School (https://esource.dbs.ie/bitstream/handle/10788/4254/msc_jeevankrishna_2020.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y )
	* Resume based (https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/6/4/147)
5. __Movies__ - content based (plot, credits, genre) e.g. https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/recommender-systems-python
6. __Academic papers__ - bibliographic recommender (https://www.scirp.org/pdf/ijis_2022012614080845.pdf)
