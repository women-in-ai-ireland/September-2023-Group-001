(Steve remembers the year of VisiCalc wrong, and his reason was only one of the reasons the Apple II was chosen first.)\r\n\r\nThere have been, if you look at why the majority of people have bought these things so far, ah there have been two real explosions that have propelled the industry forward. The first one ah really happened in 1977. And it was the spreadsheets. I remember when ah Dan Fylstra who ran the company that marketed the first spreadsheet, walked not my office at Apple one day and pulled out this disk from his vest pocket and said, \"I...I have this incredible new program. I call it a visual calculator.\" And it became VisiCalc. And that's what really drove, propelled the Apple to...to the success it achieved more than any other single event.\r\n\r\nAnd...and with ah the invention of Lotus 123, and I think it was 1982, that's what really propelled the IBM PC to the level of success that it achieved. So that was the first explosion was the spreadsheet. Ahm the second major explosion has driven our, the desktop industry has been desktop publishing.\r\n\r\nAnd:\r\n\r\nDisk drive was crucial. Ah one of the things that people forget when they think about...about Apple and the Apple II in particular was that we were the first company to come out with a reliable, inexpensive floppy disk drive. And we had a low cost floppy disk drive that really worked about two to three years before any of our competitors. And that was an incredibly important reason why the Apple II was successful. A matter of fact, ah there were a few others.\r\n\r\nThe Apple II could hold up to 48 kilobytes of memory which today doesn't seem like much, but at that time was maybe three times as much as its competitors. And that's why Visicalc was written for the Apple II. It was the only computer that could hold it. And so if Visicalc had been written for some other computer you'd be interviewing somebody else right now. And it was because of that design decision and other design decisions like it that the Apple II really beat its competition.", "date": null, "linkUrl": null, "source": null, "text": null, "timecode": "00:55", "title": null, "category": "note"}, {"__typename": "Footnote", "author": null, "annotation": "This photo is from the 1969 NASA-NSTA (National Science Teachers Association) Youth Science Congress at Goddard Space Flight Center.
