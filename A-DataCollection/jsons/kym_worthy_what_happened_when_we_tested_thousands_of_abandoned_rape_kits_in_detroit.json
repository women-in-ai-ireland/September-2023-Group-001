From 1994 to January 2004, Worthy was a judge on the Wayne County Circuit Court Criminal Division.

In 2013, Worthy sued Wayne County, alleging that Wayne County Executive Robert A. Ficano had provided her with an insufficient budget to fulfill her duties as outlined in the Michigan State Constitution.
