For instance, Selam may have had ape-like shoulders, made for climbing trees -- but her legs were angled for walking upright. Her young brain, at age 3, was still growing, which implies that she was set to have a long human-style childhood. And in the hyoid bone of her throat, Alemseged sees <strong>the beginning of human speech</strong>.<br /> </p><p>Born in Axum, Ethiopia, Alemseged is based in San Francisco at the&nbsp;California Academy of Sciences&nbsp;where is is the Director and Curator of the Anthropology department.
