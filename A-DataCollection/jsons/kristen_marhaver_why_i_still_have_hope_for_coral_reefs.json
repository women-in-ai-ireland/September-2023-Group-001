Corals are animals related to jellyfish and anemones; they\u2019re all in the animal group [Cnidaria](http://ocean.si.edu/corals-and-coral-reefs). A single coral polyp looks like a tiny anemone with a mouth, stomach, and tentacles. One big difference between anemones and corals is that corals leave a calcium carbonate (limestone) skeleton underneath themselves as they grow. Corals are also clonal, that is, they make copies of themselves through budding or by dividing in half. And corals are colonial, meaning all the individuals live together in a colony. (So, imagine standing in one place, shoulder to shoulder with 1000 clones of yourself, growing a skeleton from your feet, and growing additional clones of yourself from your shoulders. Corals do things their own way!) The result is a big colony of coral polyps, all joined together side-by-side, building a complex limestone structure underneath. This limestone creates the structure of the coral reef and provides the homes for millions of other animals.

This has been documented through the work of historical ecologists such as Dr. Loren McClenachan and Dr. Jeremy Jackson. \r\n\r\nRecently, Dr. Jeremy Jackson led a [study](http://www.reefresilience.org/article-summaries/status-and-trends-of-caribbean-coral-reefs-1970-2012-executive-summary/) to compile and synthesize all long-term ecological data from coral reefs in the Caribbean. Since 1970, the Caribbean has lost huge amounts of coral, but the full story is much more nuanced. Some Caribbean reefs are virtually collapsed, stuck below 10% coral cover.

There are many ways that human activity stresses coral reefs, which means many ways we can take action to [protect corals right away](https://www.iucn.org/content/despair-repair-dramatic-decline-caribbean-corals-can-be-reversed).\r\n", "date": null, "linkUrl": null, "source": null, "text": null, "timecode": "04:12", "title": null, "category": "note"}, {"__typename": "Footnote", "author": null, "annotation": "> \"\u2026 even as we go through bleaching events more frequent and more severe \u2026\"\r\n\r\nCorals can recover from bleaching and tissue loss\r\n\r\nA bleached coral is still alive but very stressed. If the source of stress is reversed quickly enough, a coral may be able to re-establish its algal symbiosis, and continue to grow. Often times, bleaching causes partial tissue death, but the remaining, surviving coral polyps, can still continue to grow. At the reef scale, scientists have been surprised to see how quickly some coral reefs have bounced back from bleaching when it was a [one-time occurrence](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2304595/Coral-reefs-heal-researchers--humans-leave-alone.html). Some corals, especially branching species, can regrow in less than 10 years. Other corals may need 100 years to regrow to the same size after suffering from partial mortality.\r\n", "date": null, "linkUrl": null, "source": null, "text": null, "timecode": "04:19", "title": null, "category": "note"}, {"__typename": "Footnote", "author": null, "annotation": "> \u201c\u2026 the more stresses we take away at the local scale \u2026\u201d\r\n\r\nReducing local stress helps corals survive global stress \r\n\r\nBleaching is usually triggered by a sharp rise in seawater temperature. But bleaching causes more death and damage when corals area already stressed by local factors such as fertilizer pollution, sewage pollution, overfishing, and coastal dredging.

But this is an important source of new corals for the reefs of the future, because each juvenile adds a new combination of genes to the population, and each one has the potential to live for decades or centuries. In addition, by reproducing under modern day conditions, and making babies that survive to become juveniles on the reef, corals are evolving; they\u2019re producing juveniles, and genetic combinations, that can live in modern day, human-influenced seas. Encouragingly, coral juveniles are also oftentime better at acclimating to new environments [compared to their parents](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/13-0161.1/full). Helping corals make babies is one way that scientists are playing the long game while conservationists work to establish marine protections and stabilize the planet in the short term.
