She runs <a href=\"http://www.mzalendo.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Mzalendo</a>, <strong>a pioneering civic website that tracks the performance of Kenya&#39;s Parliament</strong> and its Parliamentarians. With a vote tracker, articles and opinion pieces, the site connects Kenyans to their leaders and opens the lid on this powerful and once-secretive body. (This is a Parliament that finally agreed to have its procedings <a href=\"http://www.networkworld.com/news/2008/072508-kenyan-parliament-airs-proceedings-to.html\" target=\"_blank\">televised</a>  in <em>August 2008</em>.) </p><p>Okolloh&#39;s own blog is called <a href=\"http://www.kenyanpundit.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Kenyan Pundit</a>, and it tracks her work with Mzalendo and her other efforts as part of the rebuilding of Kenya, following the post-election violence in late 2007 (she collected a powerful series of <a href=\"http://www.kenyanpundit.com/2008/01/06/diary-1/\" target=\"_blank\">diaries of the violence</a>, dozens of essays  from Kenyans and others -- well worth a read). </p><p>Okolloh is part of a wave of young Africans who are using the power of blogging, SMS and web-enabled openness to push their countries forward and help Africans to truly connect. Tools like <a href=\"http://www.kenyanpundit.com/2008/01/22/ushahidi-local-sms-number-6007/\" target=\"_blank\">Ushahidi</a>  help to link a people whose tribal differences, as Okolloh points out again and again, are often cynically exploited by a small group of leaders.
