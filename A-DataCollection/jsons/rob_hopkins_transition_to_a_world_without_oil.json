cooperation and interdependence to shrink their ecological footprints</strong>. In the face of climate change he developed the concept of Transition Initiatives -- communities that produce their own goods and services, curb the need for transportation and take other measures to prepare for a post-oil future. While Transition shares certain principles with greenness and sustainability, it is a deeper vision concerned with re-imagining our future in a self-sufficient way and building resiliency. <br /><br />Transforming theory to action, Hopkins is also the co-founder and a resident of the first Transition Initiative in the UK, in Totnes, Devon. As he refuses to fly, it is from his home in Totnes that he offers help to hundreds of similar communities that have sprung up around the world, in part through his blog, <a href=\"http://transitionculture.org/\" target=\"_blank\">transitionculture.org</a>.<br /><br />Hopkins, who&#39;s trained in ecological design, wrote the principal work on the subject,&nbsp;<em><a href=\"http://geni.us/transitionhandbook\" target=\"_blank\">Transition Handbook: From Oil Dependency to Local Resilience</a>,</em>&nbsp;a 12-step manual for a postcarbon future.
