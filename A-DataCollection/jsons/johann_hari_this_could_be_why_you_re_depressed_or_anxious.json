broader rise in depression and anxiety has been found across [many](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165032711007993) studies, dating back to the [1980s](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/current-age-of-youthful-melancholia/0EE348A787B03791DD7061C4C0DB71AA) and [1990s](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/401629). \r\n\r\nThere is a debate within the science and mental health community whether this rise is correlated to increased prevalence of depression or simply an increase in the diagnosis of depression cases. [Some scientists](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=oWmtN3wSJmoC&oi=fnd&pg=PR7&ots=8vk49A_ZHC&sig=P_Z9pEbFQqz0SSVTUeZXxhpkw6c#v=onepage&q&f=false) argue there is a growing problem, which can be attributed to a range of factors.\r\n\r\nIn Hari\u2019s book, [*Lost Connections: Uncovering the Real Causes of Depression \u2013 and the Unexpected Solutions*](https://www.amazon.com/Lost-Connections-Uncovering-Depression-Unexpected/dp/1632868318), he expands on this debate in more detail.

This particular study is outlined by the [National Institute of Mental Health](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/funding/clinical-research/practical/stard/allmedicationlevels.shtml) and in many review papers ([here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11920-007-0061-3) and [here](https://ps.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/ps.2009.60.11.1439)).
