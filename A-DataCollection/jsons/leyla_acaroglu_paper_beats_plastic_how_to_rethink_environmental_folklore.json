Generally, the reusable bags (PET and PP) have lower environmental impacts than all of the single use bags. \r\n2. The benefits of a reusable bag are highly sensitive to the number of times each bag is used during its life. For example, if a reusable PP \u2018green bag\u2019 is only used 52 times (weekly for a year) instead of the assumed 104 times (weekly for 2 years) then its impact on global warming is higher than the impact of each of the single-use bags except the paper bag. The implication for retailers is that consumers should be encouraged to reuse existing bags rather than continuously buying new bags. \r\n3. The PP reusable bag has a lower impact than the PET reusable bag for all of the impact categories except two (solid waste and fossil fuels), assuming that both types of bags are durable enough to be reused at least 104 times. \r\n4. The \u2018best\u2019 or \u2018environmentally preferred\u2019 single use bag varies depending on the environmental impact category being considered. \r\n5. Overall the single use paper bag has the highest environmental impact as a result of pulp and paper production and the weight of material required per bag. The single use paper bag has the highest impact, or equal highest impact, for all categories except eutrophication. For most impact categories this result does not change if the bag is reused again (i.e. used for 2 shopping trips) but its relative ranking on solid waste does improve significantly, from the equal highest impact (along with recycled HDPE and the PP reusable bag), to the second lowest impact.\"\r\n\r\nA [2011 study by the Environment Agency](http://a0768b4a8a31e106d8b0-50dc802554eb38a24458b98ff72d550b.r19.cf3.rackcdn.com/scho0711buan-e-e.pdf) in the UK reported the following:\r\n\"The reuse of conventional HDPE and other lightweight carrier bags for shopping and/or as bin-liners can substantially improve their environmental performance.
