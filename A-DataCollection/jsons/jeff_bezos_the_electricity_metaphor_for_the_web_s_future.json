It&#39;s the standard by which all web businesses are now judged -- if not by their shareholders, then by their customers. Amazon set a high bar for reliability and customer service, and also <strong>introduced a wide range of online retail conventions -- from user reviews and one-click shopping to the tab interface and shopping cart icon</strong> -- so commonplace we no longer think of them as once having been innovations.<br /><br />When the Internet bubble burst, Amazon.com took a hit with the other e-commerce pioneers, but the fundamentally sound company hung tough.<strong> It now sells more than $10 billion a year of goods, profitably</strong>, and its technology will influence the changes to business and media that will come next. Amazon recently released Kindle, a wireless digital reading device, giving the term &quot;page turning&quot; a completely new definition. Bezos, meanwhile, is one of the few early Web CEOs who still run the companies they founded.
