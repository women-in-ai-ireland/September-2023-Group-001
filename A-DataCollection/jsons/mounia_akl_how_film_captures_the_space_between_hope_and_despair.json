If there is one, it is what is already here, the hell we live every day, that we make by being together. There are two ways to escape suffering it. The first is easy for many: accept the hell, and become such a part of it that you can no longer see it. The second is risky and demands constant vigilance and apprehension: seek and learn to recognize who and what, in the midst of hell, are not hell, then make them endure, give them space.\"\r\n\r\nClarification: there are several translations for *Invisible Cities* by Italo Calvino. According to the translation from *The Italian* by William Weaver, published by Harcourt Brace in 1972, the excerpt is: \"And Polo said: 'The inferno of the living is not something that will be; if there is one, it is what is already here, the inferno where we live every day, that we form by being together. There are two ways to escape suffering it. The first is easy for many: accept the inferno and become such a part of it that you can no longer see it. The second is risky and demands constant vigilance and apprehension: seek and learn to recognize who and what, in the midst of the inferno, are not inferno, then make them endure, give them space.'\" For more, see [here](https://csun.uic.edu/publications/books/Calvino_1972_Invisible_Cities.pdf).", "date": null, "linkUrl": null, "source": null, "text": null, "timecode": "7:48", "title": null, "category": "note"}]}}}, "commentsEnabled": false, "commentsLoggedInOnly": false}, "language": "en", "messages": {}, "responseCode": 200, "__N_SSP": true}
