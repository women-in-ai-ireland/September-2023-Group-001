By itself, my living in Nigeria does not warrant comment. But the discovery that I speak of put that life in a completely different light; hence these remarks. All my life in Nigeria, I lived as a Yor&ugrave;b&aacute;, a Nigerian, an African, and a human being. I occupied, by turns, several different roles. I was a hugely successful Boy Scout. I was a well-read African cultural nationalist. I was a member of the Nigerian province of the worldwide communion of the Church of England who remains completely enamored of the well-crafted sermon and of church music, often given to impromptu chanting from memory of whole psalms, the Te Deum or the Nunc Dimittis. I was a student leader of national repute. I was an aspiring revolutionary who once entertained visions of life as a guerilla in the bush. I was a frustrated journalist who, to his eternal regret, could not resist the call of the teaching profession. I was an ardent football player of limited talent. I was a budding spiritualist who has since stopped professing faith. Overall, I always believed that I was put on Earth for the twin purposes of raising hell for and catching it from those who would dare shame humanity through either ignorance or injustice or poverty.&quot;</p><p>T&aacute;&iacute;w&ograve; is the author of <em>Legal Naturalism: A Marxist Theory of Law</em> (1996/2015), <em>How Colonialism Preempted Modernity in Africa</em> (2010) and <em>Africa Must Be Modern: A Manifesto</em> (2012/2014).</p>", "slug": "olu_fe_mi_ta_i_wo"}]}, "description": "How can Africa, the home to some of the largest bodies of water in the world, be said to have a water crisis?
