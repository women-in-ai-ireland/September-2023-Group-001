While progress has been made linking neuronal properties to brain rhythms, the task of scaling up these models to link neuronal properties to cognition still remains. Making the supercomputer-performance required affordable is the goal of our <a href=\"http://www.stanford.edu/group/brainsinsilicon/goals.html\">Neurogrid</a> project. <strong>It is at the vanguard of
