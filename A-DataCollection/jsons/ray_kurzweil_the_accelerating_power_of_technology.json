Kurzweil invented the first optical character recognition (OCR) software for transforming the written word into data, the first print-to-speech software for the blind, the first text-to-speech synthesizer, and the first music synthesizer capable of recreating the grand piano and other orchestral instruments, and the first commercially marketed large-vocabulary speech recognition.<br /><br />Yet his impact as a futurist and philosopher is no less significant. In his best-selling books, which include<a href=\"http://www.howtocreateamind.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em> How to Create a Mind</em></a>, <a href=\"http://us.penguingroup.com/static/packages/us/kurzweil/start.htm\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Age of Spiritual Machines</em></a><em>, <a href=\"http://singularity.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology</a>,</em> Kurzweil depicts in detail a portrait of the human condition over the next few decades, as accelerating technologies forever blur the line between human and machine.</p><p>In 2009, he unveiled <a href=\"http://singularityu.org/overview/\" target=\"_blank\">Singularity University</a>, an institution that aims to &quot;assemble, educate and inspire leaders who strive to understand and facilitate the development of exponentially advancing technologies.&quot; He is a Director of Engineering at Google, where he heads up a team
