What <em>would</em> work is a robot who learns like we do, by trial and error, and with many separate parts that learn separate jobs. The thesis of his work which was captured in&nbsp;<em><a href=\"http://www.sonypictures.com/classics/fastcheap/\" target=\"_blank\">Fast, Cheap and Out of Control</a>,</em>went on to become the title of the great Errol Morris documentary.</p><p>A founder of <a href=\"http://www.irobot.com/\" target=\"_blank\">iRobot</a>, makers of the Roomba vacuum, Brooks is now founder and CTO of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://rethinkrobotics.com\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Rethink Robotics</span></a>, whose mission is to apply advanced robotic intelligence to manufacturing and physical labor.
