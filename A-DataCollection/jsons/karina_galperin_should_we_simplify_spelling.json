In this letter, Franklin responds to Polly's objections to his projects with playfulness, affection, conviction and common sense. Bad spelling, he contended, is a result of bad spelling rules.

This Handbook was the product of one of them, the Simplified Spelling Board, founded in the USA in 1906. It gathered distinguished scholars, educators, men of letters (Mark Twain among them). In my view, this Handbook ranks among the most solid, didactic and erudite allegations in favor of spelling simplification. It exposes the \"many anomalies\" of English spelling, and it carefully recounts its history (full of mistakes and misunderstandings) together with the history of spelling reformers. It also makes the case for reform, responds one by one to possible objections and recommends new spelling rules as well a list of words to be spelled differently.\r\n\r\nLet me add that Brander Matthews, a member of the Board, was also Theodore Roosevelt's personal friend. In 1906, he convinced the then President to issue a Presidential edict to simplify the spelling of 300 English words in official texts. He was following, as he explained in his order to the Government Printing Office, \"the views of the ablest and most practical educators of our time as well as of the most profound scholars.\" Ridiculed by the press and political opponents, this attempt failed.
