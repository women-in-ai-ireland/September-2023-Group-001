He delves into questions central to this national moment: How do we achieve success outside of a superstructure designed to suppress us? How do we rescue each other from suffering and heal from trauma without forsaking our identities? At a time when so many of us are losing faith in American institutions and reckoning with systematic injustice, Gerald brings a human and profoundly intimate voice to this collective anger and growing disillusionment, while suggesting how we might build a new foundation strong enough to sustain the richness of all that we are.</p><p class=\"p1\">Gerald grew up in Oak Cliff, Texas, and went to Yale, where he played varsity football.
