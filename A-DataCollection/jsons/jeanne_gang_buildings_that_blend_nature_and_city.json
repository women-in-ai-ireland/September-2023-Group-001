In the 20th century, as patrolling by car replaced the traditional foot beat, police stations tended to become large-scale, fortress-like structures. Today Chicago\u2019s prototypical stations are often sited on major thoroughfares and flanked by expansive parking lots, isolating police and their stations from the communities they serve. Chicago\u2019s 10th District Police Station in the city\u2019s North Lawndale neighborhood is one of fourteen prototypical stations built across the city between 1999 and 2012.
