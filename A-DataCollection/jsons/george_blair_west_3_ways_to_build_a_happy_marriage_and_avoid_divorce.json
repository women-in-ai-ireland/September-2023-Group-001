While this might sound like an obvious thing to do, no one had thought to do this before. He proved that healthy couples were not simply the opposite of unhealthy couples. One finding that I share with couples all the time is that he found that, contrary to expectations, healthy couples had lots of negative interactions. What defined them, however, was the greater extent of their positive interactions and their commitment to having fun together.\r\n\r\nJohn's [blog](https://www.gottman.com/blog/) is particularly worth subscribing to. It offers articles with very practical tips on relationship issues with contributions from other professionals as well as Gottman. Topics include dating, relationships, conflict management and parenting as well as the latest research in these areas.

that's our current divorce rate.\"\r\n\r\nClarification: This is, by necessity, a reductionist figure, as divorce demography varies from country to country -- with a surprising range. Data from [the UN](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/products/dyb/dyb2014.htm) gives a ratio of [divorce](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/products/dyb/dyb2014/Table24.pdf) to [marriage](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/products/dyb/dyb2014/Table22.pdf) in Ireland of only 14 percent in 2012, while in Portugal it was 74 percent during that same year. Sitting in the mid-range we have the UK (46 percent in 2011) and my homeland of Australia (40 percent in 2013). With the diversity of the USA, the [lifetime risk of divorce](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1741-3737.2010.00723.x) sits between 42 and 45% percent. With all these numbers in mind, I have rounded it to 45 percent. Two points of note: (1) these are \"crude rates\" and not as statistically informative as the annualized \"divorce to marriage ratio\" and (2) as millennials marry later and become more educated (as I touch on later in this talk) early indicators (further confirmed by data since my talk in 2017) are that divorce rates are falling, however marriage rates are too, just to confuse the picture further. Please follow these links for more information about declining divorce and marriage rates in [Australia](https://aifs.gov.au/facts-and-figures/marriage-and-divorce-rates), the [UK](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/divorce/bulletins/divorcesinenglandandwales/2017) and the [USA](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/marriage-divorce.htm).", "date": null, "linkUrl": null, "source": null, "text": null, "timecode": "02:03", "title": null, "category": "note"}, {"__typename": "Footnote", "author": null, "annotation": "> \"... millennials spend seven-plus hours on their devices a day.\"\r\n\r\nClarification: According to the Fall 2016 Ipsos Affluent Survey USA, *affluent* millennials (with a household income of at least $100,000) spend 53 hours per week online, or an average of 7.5 hours of internet time per day. In comparison, the average US adult spends a total of 5 hours and 42 minutes on digital media activities each day. To review a summary of the report, see [here](https://www.emarketer.com/Article/Among-Affluents-Millennials-Spend-Most-Time-Online/1014618). More recent data from [Nielsen Total Audience Report: 2018](https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/reports/2018/q1-2018-total-audience-report.html) found that American adults spend over 11 hours per day listening to, watching, reading or generally interacting with media.", "date": null, "linkUrl": null, "source": null, "text": null, "timecode": "03:49", "title": null, "category": "note"}, {"__typename": "Footnote", "author": null, "annotation": "> \"Now, before you go out and get all moral on me, remember that Generation X, in the American Public Report, they found that 91 percent of women had had premarital sex by the age of 30.\"\r\n\r\nThis 91 percent estimate comes from the 2002 National Survey of Family Growth, the findings of which were published in *Public Health Reports* (2007).

It is also worth noting that more recent data from the ABS ([2017](http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/3310.0)) shows the median ages at marriage for both men and women have increased, albeit only fractionally such that they still round to 30 and 32.", "date": null, "linkUrl": null, "source": null, "text": null, "timecode": "05:06", "title": null, "category": "note"}, {"__typename": "Footnote", "author": null, "annotation": "> \"And thirdly, and most importantly to my mind, is personality.

The chance of their evolution aligning as they age, even if one them were not to evolve or change, is unlikely. Personality continues to evolve to a significant degree until around the age of 30, when it begins to stabilize. At this point we have greater correlations with one's personality at age 50 (albeit a somewhat arbitrary comparison point). Just as we have come to realize that the brain keeps actively developing and evolving throughout life, [recent research](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-8721.2008.00543.x), not too surprisingly, has found the same for personality.
