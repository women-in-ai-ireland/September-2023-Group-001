The authors of *A General Theory of Love,* written in 2001, write this: \"The scientist and artist both speak to the turmoil that comes from having a triune brain. A person cannot direct his emotional life in the way he bids his motor system to reach for a cup. He cannot will himself to want the right thing, or to love the right person, or to be happy after a disappointment, or even to be happy in happy times. People lack this capacity not through a deficiency of discipline but because of the jurisdiction of will is limited to the latest brain and to those functions within its purview. Emotional life can be influenced, but it cannot be commanded. Our society's love affair with mechanical devices that respond at a button-touch does not prepare us to deal with the unruly organic mind that dwells within. Anything that does not comply must be broken or poorly designed.\" Our neocortical brain has the ability to organize and convey logic and reason. The limbic brain inspires and can involuntarily feel love. Yet, according to Lewis, \"The verbal rendition of emotional material demands a difficult transmutation ...

But I am not really worried about my shoes. But when the Nike folks say, 'Just do it,' they're peering into my soul. I begin to feel that, if they understand me that well, their shoes are probably pretty good. I am then willing to join the tribe of Nike.\" But to see the world in brand tribes is to take possession of much more than just a theory of the world. It is to possess a theory of all the activity in it, perhaps an entire science, an ethology that could tell us everything we want to know about human behavior.\r\n\r\nI think the way Neumeier describes brands is probably the one of the most poetic and forgiving of the place that products now have in our lives. The mammalian part of our brain is indeed the part of the brain that makes us want to be part of a tribe, and I do think that we buy the brands that make us feel part of that tribe in order to be able to participate in that tribe. But I think it goes deeper than that. We are buying brands and products to be part of a tribe because now, in the day and age and culture and world we are living in, we are otherwise tribeless. We feel tribeless and disconnected because, despite our technological connectedness, we are emotionally and physically further away from our friends and family than ever before in human history.

It gets its name from the Sanskrit word *svastika,* meaning \"well-being, good fortune and luck\" and actually refers to the Indian mystic figure svastikaya. It was found among India's first civilized remains, as early as 2500 BC. It was even carved into The Foot of Buddha, a sacred Buddhist stone carving. Prior to its transfiguration, it served as religious phylactery, occult talisman, scientific symbol, guild emblem, meteorological implement, commercial trademark, architectural ornament, printing fleuron and military insignia.
