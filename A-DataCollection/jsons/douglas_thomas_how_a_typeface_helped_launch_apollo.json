the designer who made this in 1927, employed.\"\r\n\r\nClarification: Like many art forms, typefaces can take years to create. Renner began his design process of Futura in 1924. The first commercial release of Futura happened in 1927. For the full chronology of Paul Renner's typography, see Philipp Luidl's book [*Paul Renner: Eine Jahresage der Typographischen Gesellschaft M\u00fcnchen*](https://www.worldcat.org/title/paul-renner-eine-jahresgabe-der-typographischen-gesellschaft-munchen/oclc/5944189) and, for a deeper explication on the evolution of Futura, see Christopher Burke's book [*Paul Renner: The Art of Typography*](https://www.amazon.com/Paul-Renner-Typography-Christopher-Burke/dp/1568981589).

What's amazing about this name -- you know, what's in this name is that this is a name that actually invokes hope and an idea about the future.\"\r\n\r\nBeyond the smart marketing name Futura, Bauer Type Foundry did well at selling Futura also partially due to good timing. Futura was created and marketed during a period of relative economic stability in Germany (about 1924-29). This period, aided by loans from the US State Department known as the [Dawes Plan](https://history.state.gov/milestones/1921-1936/dawes), gave the German economy a reprieve from post-war years of hyperinflation, even if it only lasted until the Great Depression. Had Futura been sold a few years before or after, it may never have found a place in the US market.

The *Times* joked that the \"anti-capitalist\" lowercase revolution had been compromised with a \"New Punctuation Policy,\" which, like Lenin's New Economic Policy, had reinfused elements of capitalism into a Communist economy. The unchanged, left-justified layout is satirized too: \"They do not put the name of an article in the centre of the page or in the centre of the column, but put it flush with the left-hand edge of the type column.

So for Americans who wanted to adopt this and make it part of their own system, something they could use in everyday typography, whether in ads or anything else, they actually had to have metal type.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1927, Futura was only available in metal type (also known as foundry type). It later became available in numerous other printing technologies in the 20th century, including machine-cast type (copies or similar typefaces starting in 1929, official licensed versions in 1937), wood type (circe 1936), photo type (1960s) and digital type (1980s-present).

Use 20th century, use Spartan, use Vogue, use Tempo. These are all identical to Futura.'\"\r\n\r\nClarification: Spartan, Monotype 20th Century, Linotype Tempo and Intertype Vogue all competed directly and were copied directly from Futura. Even when the typefaces had subtle differences from Futura, the type foundries created and sold alternate characters that made their typefaces nearly indistinguishable from Futura. Even distinct visual competitors like Linotype Metro or British Monotype Gill Sans sold alternate versions bringing their designs closer to a Futura-like ideal. Futura's dominance in the market was so complete that many of the competing typefaces were marketed to advertisers and print shops as Futura or Futuria.
