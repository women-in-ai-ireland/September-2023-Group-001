And Ben Saunders&#39; stories of arctic exploration -- as impressive for their technical ingenuity as their derring-do -- are decidedly modern. In 2004, at age 26, he skied solo to the North Pole, updating his blog  each day of the trip. Humble and self-effacing, Saunders is an explorer of limits, whether it&#39;s how far a human can be pushed physically and psychologically, or how technology works hundreds of miles from civilization.   His message is one of inspiration, empowerment and boundless potential. <br /><br />He urges audiences to consider carefully how to spend the &ldquo;tiny amount of time we each have on this planet.&rdquo; Saunders is also a powerful advocate for the natural world. He&#39;s seen first-hand the effects of climate change, and his expeditions are raising awareness for sustainable solutions.&nbsp;</p><p>Being the youngest person to ski solo to the North Pole did not satiate Saunders&#39; urge to explore and push the boundaries. In 2008, he attempted to break the speed record for a solo walk to the North Pole; however, his journey was ended abruptly both then and again in 2010 due to equipment failure. From October 2013 to February 2014, he led a two-man team to retrace Captain Robert Falcon Scott&rsquo;s ill-fated 1,800-mile expedition to the South Pole on foot. He calls this journey the hardest 105 days of his life.</p>", "slug": "ben_saunders"}]}, "description": "Arctic explorer Ben Saunders recounts his harrowing solo ski trek to the North Pole, complete
