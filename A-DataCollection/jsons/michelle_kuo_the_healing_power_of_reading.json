I learned, and I tried to become less innocent. I planted myself as a teacher in the rural South, where I was one of the only Asians in a majority black area ravaged by a long history of white supremacy. I have re-read Baldwin many times since then. As I grow older, I'm interested as well in his self-consciousness, his passionate belief in the relationship between pursuing authenticity in one's interior life and pursuing justice in external social forces. \"One can only face in others what one can face in oneself,\" he writes. I've come to think he means that we can't recognize the compassion, ambivalence and capacity for evil in others unless we first plumb those depths in ourselves. \r\n\r\nAs I write in *Reading with Patrick*, I had the joy of sharing Baldwin with Patrick in a county jail in Arkansas. He was especially moved by Baldwin\u2019s letter to his nephew, which he immediately grasped as a vessel of love between generations.
