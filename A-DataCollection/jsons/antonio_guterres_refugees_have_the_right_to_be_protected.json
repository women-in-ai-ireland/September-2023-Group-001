Since taking office January 2017, he has worked to promote peace, advance prevention, combat hatred and mobilize ambition in fighting the climate emergency and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.</p><p class=\"p1\">Guterres has also recognized the need for the United Nations itself to be more innovative and effective, and has set in motion wide-ranging reforms to make full use of new technology and to enhance agility, transparency and accountability. He has also pressed to make the organization more equal, including through gender parity -- with major milestones met well ahead of schedule -- and improved geographical representation.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"p1\">Mr. Guterres has proclaimed himself a proud multilateralist. &quot;But international cooperation cannot be taken for granted.&quot; he has stressed. &quot;We must prove its value by addressing the real problems people face.&quot;</p><p class=\"p1\">Guterres was born in Lisbon in 1949 and graduated from the Instituto Superior T&eacute;cnico with a degree in engineering.
