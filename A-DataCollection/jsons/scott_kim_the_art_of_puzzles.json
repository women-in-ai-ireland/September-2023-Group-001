hundreds of puzzles</strong> for magazines, and thousands for computer games.

He specializes in ambigrams, or inversions: for example, a word that reads more than one way. His first puzzles appeared in <em>Scientific American</em> in Martin Gardner&#39;s Mathematical Games column, and are now included in many different books, toys and games. His games can also be played on his&nbsp;website&nbsp;or found on greeting cards. Kim&#39;s 1981 book, <a href=\"http://geni.us/3cnm\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Inversions</em></a>, features a collection of &quot;inversions&quot; -- a word or name written so it reads in more than one way.
