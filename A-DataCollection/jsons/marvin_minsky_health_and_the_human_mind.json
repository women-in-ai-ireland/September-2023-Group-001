The book&#39;s sequel,<a href=\"http://geni.us/emotionmachine\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Emotion Machine</em></a>&nbsp;(2006), says similar activity also accounts for feelings, goals, emotions and conscious thoughts.</p><p>Minsky also <strong>pioneered advances in mathematics, computational linguistics, optics, robotics and telepresence</strong>. He built SNARC, the first neural network simulator, some of the first visual scanners, and the first LOGO &quot;turtle.&quot; From his headquarters at MIT&#39;s Media Lab and the AI Lab (which he helped found), he continues to work on, as he says, &quot;imparting to machines the human capacity for commonsense reasoning.&quot;</p>", "slug": "marvin_minsky"}]}, "description": "Listen closely --
