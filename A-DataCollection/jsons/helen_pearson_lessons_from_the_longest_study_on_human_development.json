Today, they are some of the best-studied people on the planet, and the simple act of observing human life has changed the way we are born, schooled, parent and die. These studies have arguably touched the lives of almost every person in Britain today, yet they are one of our best-kept secrets.

Several studies support this assertion, showing that poorer children have weaker educational attainment (e.g. Gregg and Machin, 1999), and are more likely to end up in poverty in adulthood (Blanden and Gibbons, 2006).

While educational achievement and occupational mobility led to improvements in socioeconomic circumstances and were associated with better health, those with a poor start to life were not able to make up the full health deficit. Indeed, the NSHD has also shown that the chance of survival up to age 60 years was influenced by social advantage or disadvantage in childhood as well as by adult socioeconomic experience, particularly for women. Social inequalities in health tend to be greatest in childhood and at older ages, and narrowest during the young adult years. With the benefit of repeated measures over time, the NSHD showed that the increases in obesity (from age 20 to 53), in blood pressure (from age 36 to 53) and in limitations in mobility and other aspects of daily function (between age 43 and 53) were greater in those who experienced more lifetime socioeconomic disadvantage.'\r\n", "date": null, "linkUrl": null, "source": null, "text": null, "timecode": "04:42", "title": null, "category": "note"}, {"__typename": "Footnote", "author": null, "annotation": "> Now, I talked about what happens later, but some of these differences emerge at a really shockingly early age.\r\n\r\nPress release from the Centre for Longitudinal Studies:\r\n\r\nDisadvantaged children up to a year behind by the age of three, 11 June 2007 http://bit.ly/2udFN0k\r\n\r\nAn [impact report on the Millennium cohort study](http://www.cls.ioe.ac.uk/library-media/documents/Impact case studies - Millennium Cohort Study - November 2011.pdf) also summarizes these findings.\u2018Cognitive development: The second MCS survey revealed that many children from disadvantaged backgrounds and from ethnic minority families were, educationally, up to a year behind their most privileged peers by age 3.
