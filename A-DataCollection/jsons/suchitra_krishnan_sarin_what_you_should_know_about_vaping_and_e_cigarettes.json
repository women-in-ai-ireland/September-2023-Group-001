However, the animal literature demonstrates that animals who are exposed to nicotine develop anxiety and depression-like behaviors. For a good summary of the literature, see Page 180 of England, Lucinda J., et al. \"[Developmental Toxicity of Nicotine: A Transdisciplinary Synthesis and Implications for Emerging Tobacco Products](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2016.11.013).\" *Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews*, 72; 2017, pp. 176\u2013189.", "date": null, "linkUrl": null, "source": null, "text": null, "timecode": "10:00", "title": null, "category": "note"}, {"__typename": "Footnote", "author": null, "annotation": "> \"Now, in adolescent animals, nicotine also produces epigenetic changes or heritable changes in gene expression, for example, in the genes involved in asthma.\"\r\n\r\nSeveral studies have observed epigenetic change as a result of nicotine exposure. These changes are basic changes to the genetic structure of an individual and are not necessarily specific to adolescence. The example I use here cites [Leslie, FM 2013](https://doi.org/10.1186/1741-7015-11-27), which demonstrated an induced epigenetic change to cause asthma-like lung function in adolescent rats that were exposed to nicotine. These epigenetic changes were shown to be heritable, causing asthma-like symptoms in subsequent generations.
