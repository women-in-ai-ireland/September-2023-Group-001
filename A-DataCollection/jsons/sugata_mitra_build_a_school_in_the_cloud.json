What they saw: kids from the slum playing with the computer and, in the process, learning how to use it -- then teaching each other. These famed &ldquo;Hole in the Wall&rdquo; experiments demonstrated that, in the absence of supervision and formal teaching, children can teach themselves and each other -- if they&rsquo;re motivated by curiosity. Mitra, now a professor of educational technology at <a href=\"http://egwestcentre.com/research/holeinthewall/\" target=\"_blank\">Newcastle University</a>, called it &quot;minimally invasive education.&quot;</p><p>Mitra thinks self-organized learning will shape the future of education.
