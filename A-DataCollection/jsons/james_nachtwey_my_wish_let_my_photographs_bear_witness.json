However, when certain stories he wanted to cover -- such as <a href=\"http://www.jamesnachtwey.com/jn/slides/g14.html\" target=\"_blank\">Romanian orphanages</a>  and <a href=\"http://www.jamesnachtwey.com/jn/slides/g26.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"famine in Somalia\">famine in Somalia</a>  -- garnered no interest from magazines, he self-financed trips there. He is known for getting up close to his subjects, or as he says, &quot;in the same intimate space that the subjects inhabit,&quot; and he passes that sense of closeness on to the viewer. <br /><br
