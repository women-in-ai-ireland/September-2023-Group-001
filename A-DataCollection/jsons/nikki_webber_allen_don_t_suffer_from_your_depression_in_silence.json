Only about one-quarter of African Americans seek mental health care, compared to 40 percent of whites. Some reasons why:\r\n\r\nDistrust and misdiagnosis. Historically, African Americans have been and continue to be negatively affected by prejudice and discrimination in the healthcare system. Misdiagnoses, inadequate treatment and lack of cultural competence by health professionals cause distrust and prevent many African Americans from seeking or staying in treatment.\r\nSocio-economic factors play a part too and can make treatment options less available. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, as of 2012, 19% of African Americans had no form of health insurance.

About 84 percent of the deaths occurred among boys. Hanging and suffocation was the most common method. \r\n\r\nThe overall suicide rate remained stable at about one suicide per one million children during the 20-year period.\r\nHowever, the suicide rate nearly doubled among black children during that time while it fell among white children, the researchers found.\r\n\r\nSource: [Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-pediatrics-suicide-race/suicide-rates-rising-among-young-black-children-in-u-s-idUSKBN0O425520150520)", "date": null, "linkUrl": null, "source": null, "text": null, "timecode": "03:50", "title": null, "category": "note"}, {"__typename": "Footnote", "author": null, "annotation": "> Now, here's the good news: seventy percent of people struggling with depression will improve with therapy, treatment, and medication.\r\n\r\nUp to 70 percent of people who have depression show substantial improvement as measured by commonly used rating scales, such as the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD), but they require additional psychosocial interventions for achieving complete remission. It is estimated that 10 to 30 percent of patients with major depression do not respond to typical antidepressant medications, and this group of patients needs trials of a variety of treatment strategies. For this purpose, it is particularly important to determine the adequacy and outcome of prior treatment trials by using the Antidepressant Treatment History Form that helps to exclude \"pseudoresistance\" cases. Complete remission is achieved in 70 to 90 percent of patients with depression, leaving 10 to 30 percent refractory to treatment, and managed by a variety of therapeutic modalities.
