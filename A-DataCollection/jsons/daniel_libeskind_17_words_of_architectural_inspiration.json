He also created the spectacular extension to the Denver Art Museum (completed in 2006), and construction is under way on a massive retail complex on the strip in Las Vegas.<br /><br />Libeskind&#39;s ambitious and highly controversial design for the rebuilt World Trade Center is perhaps his most well known project, and despite almost a decade of political wrangling and bureaucratic whittling, he insists that <strong>the final design will retain the spirit of his original renderings</strong>. </p>", "slug": "daniel_libeskind"}]}, "description": "Daniel Libeskind builds on very big ideas.
