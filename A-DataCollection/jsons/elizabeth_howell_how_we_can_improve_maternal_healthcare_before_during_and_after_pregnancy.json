maternal morbidity occurs in more than 50,000 deliveries every year. A [statistical brief](https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb243-Severe-Maternal-Morbidity-Delivery-Trends-Disparities.pdf) by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) reports a severe maternal morbidity rate of 146.6 per 10,000 deliveries in 2015. There were [approximately four million deliveries](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/births.htm) in 2015, which suggests that severe maternal morbidity occurred in nearly 60,000 deliveries as of that year.", "date": null, "linkUrl": null, "source": null, "text": null, "timecode": "03:03", "title": null, "category": "note"}, {"__typename": "Footnote", "author": null, "annotation": "> \"It's estimated that somewhere between 1.5 and two percent of the four million deliveries that occur every year in this country are associated with one of these events. That is five or six women every hour having a blood clot, a seizure, a stroke, receiving a blood transfusion, having end-organ damage such as kidney failure, or some other tragic event.\"\r\n\r\nThese data come from the AHRQ [report](https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb243-Severe-Maternal-Morbidity-Delivery-Trends-Disparities.pdf) reflecting national estimates and from [population-based data](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/data/severe-maternal-morbidity-data.pdf) from New York City. This translates into, on average, between five and seven women experiencing one of these severe complications every hour: (60,000 events / 365 days) / 24 hours = 6.8 events per hour.
