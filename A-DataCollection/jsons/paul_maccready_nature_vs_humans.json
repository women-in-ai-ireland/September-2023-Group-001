His early training as a fighter and glider pilot (glider pilots still use the &quot;MacCready speed ring&quot; he developed after World War II) led him to <strong>explore nontraditional flight and nontraditional energy sources</strong>.  </p><p>In the 1970s, <strong>he and his company, AeroVironment, designed and built two record-breaking human-powered planes</strong>: the <a href=\"http://www.donaldmonroe.com/gossamer_condor_photography\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Gossamer Condor</em></a>, the first human-powered aircraft to complete a one-mile course set by the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kremer_prize\" target=\"_blank\">Kremer Prize</a>, and the <a href=\"http://www.donaldmonroe.com/gossamer_albatross_photography\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Gossamer Albatross</em></a>, the first to cross the English Channel. The planes&#39; avian names reveal the deep insight that MacCready brought to the challenge -- that large birds, in their wing shape and flying style, possess an elegant secret of flight.</p><p>He then turned his wide-ranging mind toward environmentally responsible design, <strong>informed by his belief that human expansion poses a grave threat to the natural world</strong>. His team at AeroVironment prototyped an electric car that became General Motors&#39; pioneering EV-1. They explored alternative energy sources, including <a href=\"http://www.avinc.com/Energy_Lab_Details.asp?Prodid=52\" target=\"_blank\">building-top wind turbines</a>. And they developed <a href=\"http://www.aerovironment.com/ADC_Projects.asp\" target=\"_blank\">a fleet of fascinating aircraft</a> -- including his <a href=\"http://www.avinc.com/pr_detail.asp?ID=29\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Helios</em> </a> solar-powered glider, built to fly in the very top 2 percent of Earth&#39;s atmosphere, and the 2005 <a href=\"http://www.popsci.com/popsci/bown2005/aviationspace/4eb21d15cc827010vgnvcm1000004eecbccdrcrd.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Global Observer</em></a>, the first unmanned plane powered by hydrogen cells. </p><p>&nbsp;</p>", "slug": "paul_maccready"}]}, "description": "In 1998, aircraft designer Paul MacCready looks at a planet on which humans have utterly dominated nature, and talks about what we all can do to preserve nature's balance.
