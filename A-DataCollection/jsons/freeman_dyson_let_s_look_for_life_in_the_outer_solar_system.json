It would be wrong, however, to categorize him as a publicity-hungry peddler of headline-grabbing ideas. In his 60-year career as one of planet Earth&#39;s most distinguished scientists, several things characterize Dyson more than anything else: compassion, caution and overwhelming humanism.<br /><br />In addition to his work as a scientist, Dyson was a renowned and best-selling author. His book&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/manycoloredglass\" target=\"_blank\"><em>A Many-Colored Glass</em></a>&nbsp;tackles nothing less than biotechnology, religion and the role of life in the universe. He didn&#39;t not shy away from controversy; his critiques of the politics of the global warming debate raised the hackles of some environmentalists. But far from wielding his conclusions like a bludgeon, Dyson wanted younger generations of scientists to take away one thing from his work -- the necessity to create heresies of their own.</p>", "slug": "freeman_dyson"}]}, "description": "Physicist Freeman Dyson suggests that we start looking for life on the moons of Jupiter and out past Neptune, in the Kuiper belt and the Oort cloud.
