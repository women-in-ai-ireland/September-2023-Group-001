In this theory's highly curved geometry, Kaluza-Klein particles\u2014those particles with momentum in the extra dimensions\u2014would have a mass of about a TeV; thus there is a real possibility of producing them at colliders in the near future. They would be created like any other particle and they would decay in much the same way. Experiments could then look at their decay products and reconstruct the mass and spin that is their distinguishing property. The graviton is the only particle we know about that has spin 2. The many Kaluza-Klein particles associated with the graviton would also have spin 2 and could, therefore, be readily identified. Observation of these particles would be strong evidence of the existence of additional dimensions and would suggest that this theory is correct.\"", "date": null, "linkUrl": null, "source": null, "text": null, "timecode": "09:43", "title": null, "category": "note"}, {"__typename": "Footnote", "author": null, "annotation": "\"[the graviton] is one of the only hypothesized particles that has the special quantum properties that could give us our little two-photon bump\"\r\n\r\nThe quantum property is called spin angular momentum, and particles can have it in either integer values or half-integer values.  Particles with integer values of spin follow special rules.  A photon has spin 1, and, according to the [Landau-Yang theorem](https://journals.aps.org/pr/abstract/10.1103/PhysRev.77.242), another particle with spin 1 cannot decay to two photons.  This makes it impossible for our two-photon bump to be produced by a heavier cousin of the Z boson, called a Z' (Z-prime) (which we also search for at the LHC), because the Z' would have spin 1, as well.  So that leaves two possibilities: a spin 0 particle that would be a heavier cousin of the Higgs boson (also spin 0) or a spin 2 particle, which would have to be a graviton.

This means that if you\u2019re lucky, the new particle will have a large coupling to known particles -- a high rate of production in collisions -- and it will show up as a big bump with only a little bit of data, and if you\u2019re not-so-lucky the new particle will have a small coupling -- a low rate of production -- and you\u2019ll have to collide protons and collect data for several years before seeing a detectable effect.", "date": null, "linkUrl": null, "source": null, "text": null, "timecode": "13:28", "title": null, "category": "note"}, {"__typename": "Footnote", "author": null, "annotation": "\"Planning is already underway for a 100-kilometer tunnel colliding particles at ten times the energy of the LHC.\"\r\n\r\nA future circular collider will be [hosted](https://home.cern/about/accelerators/future-circular-collider) at [CERN](http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2014/feb/06/cern-kicks-off-plans-for-lhc-successor) or -- in a slightly smaller but still very-high-energy guise -- in [China](https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/201605/china-heir.cfm).", "date": null, "linkUrl": null, "source": null, "text": null, "timecode": "13:59", "title": null, "category": "note"}, {"__typename": "Footnote", "author": null, "annotation": "\"We already use artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques in parts of the LHC, but imagine building a particle physics experiment with such sophisticated algorithms that it could teach itself\"\r\n\r\nWe use neural networks and machine learning in a variety of ways when we analyze our LHC data, but they are still operated and directed by physicists.  For example, our ability to look at a given blob of energy that hits our electromagnetic calorimeters and determine whether this blob came from a photon or from a spray of hadronic particles (a \"jet\") is greatly aided by artificial neural networks, [which were used in the ATLAS search for the Higgs boson](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140%252Fepjc%252Fs10052-016-4507-9).

We'll need to go back to our assumptions and determine if there's a flaw somewhere.\"\r\n\r\nThe LHC was built to operate at 13 TeV -- the as-yet highest energy ever -- because we had quite a lot of experimental and theoretical suggestions that some new things would be right around the corner, within its energy reach, namely the Higgs boson and evidence of beyond-the-Standard Model (BSM) particles that would help explain unanswered questions such as why gravity is so weak compared to the other forces of nature.  We discovered the Higgs boson, which is a fantastic triumph.  And so far no BSM particles have shown up at the LHC -- with the caveat that, as mentioned in the talk, right now, in 2016, we have just begun our two decades of exploration at the 13 TeV energy frontier.  It\u2019s a magnificently exciting time to be working at the LHC, because we\u2019re at the mapping-out-the-mapping stage, discussing how to best use our detectors to ensure that we don\u2019t miss the new discovery wherever it may be hiding, such as with long-lived particle signatures or atypical detector objects.\r\n\r\nHowever, \"right around the corner\" in theoretical terms really means \"at the TeV scale,\" and 13 TeV is on the low range of \"the TeV scale\" compared to a hundred or a few hundred TeV that could be reached with the next generation of colliders.  Our current duty as physicists is to explore as much of the TeV scale as we can, meaning a larger collider operating at higher energy.\r\n\r\nBut if, after all of that, in fifty or a hundred years from now, the Standard Model reigns supreme and we still find no dark matter, no evidence for supersymmetry, no hyperdimensional gravitons, it may mean that new physics may be a bit farther away than we think.  Not a few hundred TeV away, but perhaps sixteen orders of magnitude away at something called the Planck scale, the smallest and highest-energy scale defined by quantum mechanics.  It\u2019s totally ridiculous to underestimate human ingenuity and to claim that we will never be able to reach the Planck scale, but it will require advancements in technology beyond what we have available.\r\n\r\nAt that point, it will be necessary to simultaneously really interrogate our basic assumptions.  As it stands, we have no reason to think that the bases of all of physics and nature -- things like Lorentz invariance, the renormalization group equations, and charge-parity-time (CPT) conservation -- are flawed or wrong.  But without a way to merge quantum field theory and general relativity, the only conclusion is that something is missing.  We may find it at the LHC.  We may find it at the next generation of collider.  Or our current understanding may be superseded by a larger, more universal theory of which our current theory is only a subset.  This doesn\u2019t mean that our current versions of physics are wrong; they\u2019re clearly completely correct up to the limits that we\u2019re able to test.  But we\u2019ve now reached the point in the history of particle physics where we have no more guaranteed results, no more ace-in-the-hole particles that have been necessarily predicted and must be found or our current models make no sense, as with particles like the charm quark or the W and Z bosons, in the past.
