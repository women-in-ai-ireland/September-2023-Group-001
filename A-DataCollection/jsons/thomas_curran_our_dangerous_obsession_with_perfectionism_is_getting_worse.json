And we're beginning to see similar trends emerge across Canada, and in my home country, the United Kingdom.\"\r\n\r\nClarification: This figure of 25 percent is a rough approximation of available CDC data. From [1999-2014](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db241.pdf), age-adjusted suicide rates were reported to have increased 24 percent in the US, while more recent data for [2000-2016](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db309.htm) put this age-adjusted suicide rate at roughly 30 percent.\r\n\r\nThe similar trends I was referring to in the UK and Canada are specific to recent rates of suicide among young people aged 15-19. For example, while suicide rates have generally [decreased](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/suicidesintheunitedkingdom/2016registrations) in the UK since 1988, data from the UK Office for National Statistics ([Table 8](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/datasets/suicidesintheunitedkingdomreferencetables)) highlights that, between 2007 and 2017, the highest rates for this age group came from 2015-2017.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, in Canada, 23 percent of deaths in 2009 for individuals aged 15-19 were from suicide, higher than the 9 percent of deaths in 1974 (however, this higher proportion is mostly due to the overall decline in accidental deaths). Suicide was also the second leading cause of death for individuals aged 15-34 in Canada in 2009, according to data cited in pages 6-7 in: Navaneelan, Tanya (2012).

We can also use the regression line to estimate the mean and standard deviation for 2050, assuming current trends.
