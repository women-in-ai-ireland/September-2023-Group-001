A champion cross-country skier in training for the Calgary Olympics, Janine&rsquo;s life changed forever when she was hit by a truck during a bicycle ride in the Blue Mountains of Australia. Doctors did not expect her to survive.</p><p> After six months in hospital&mdash;nearly all of it on her back&mdash;Janine focused intently on healing both her broken body and crushed morale. A turning point in her recovery came when a small plane flying overhead gave her the most improbable idea.   &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; she exclaimed from her wheelchair.  &ldquo;If I can&rsquo;t walk, I&rsquo;ll fly.&rdquo; </p><p> Still encased in a full body cast, Janine had to be lifted into an aircraft for her introductory flight lesson. But within a year she had defied the odds and earned her private pilot&rsquo;s license. Her talent and skill as a pilot earned Janine a commercial pilot license and ultimately, her flying instructor&rsquo;s rating.  Then she decided to learn to fly upside down, and finally, to teach acrobatic flight to other pilots.</p><p> Janine is an ambassador for Spinal Cure Australia and Red Bull Wings For Life, and is committed to helping find a cure for spinal cord injury in the near future. She was awarded the Order of Australia, the nation&rsquo;s highest honor. She is a contributor to Deepak Chopra&rsquo;s workshops, and has been featured on <em>60 Minutes</em> and <em>This Is Your Life.</em> </p><p> In the meantime, she seeks to inspire those coping with physical disability and life challenges.
