However, according to [research from the Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2014/10/08/how-often-do-third-party-candidates-actually-spoil-elections-not-very/), only about 6.7 percent of 'three-or-more candidate races' in federal general election races from 2006 to 2012 had the third candidate beat the  margin of victory, landing them in what they referred to as the \"spoiler zone.\"", "date": null, "linkUrl": null, "source": null, "text": null, "timecode": "", "title": null, "category": "note"}, {"__typename": "Footnote", "author": null, "annotation": "> \u201cThe founders foresaw our situation.
