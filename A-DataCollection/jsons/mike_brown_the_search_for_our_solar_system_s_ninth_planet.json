He'd been tracking the position of Uranus across the night sky using old star catalogs, and it didn't quite go around the Sun the way that his predictions said it should. Sometimes it was a little too fast, sometimes a little too slow. Bouvard knew that his predictions were perfect. So it had to be that those old star catalogs were bad.\"\r\n\r\nIt is often stated that Bouvard was open to the idea that something was disturbing the orbit of Uranus, but he is quite clear in his 1821 [treatise](https://books.google.com/books?id=E2xbAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA92&dq=bouvard++uranus&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi74Lbx9PTlAhWYHzQIHToYCe8Q6wEwAHoECAAQAQ#v=onepage&q=bouvard%20%20uranus&f=false).\r\n", "date": null, "linkUrl": null, "source": null, "text": null, "timecode": "00:05", "title": null, "category": "note"}, {"__typename": "Footnote", "author": null, "annotation": "> \"And so when Pluto was discovered in 1930 at the Lowell Observatory, everybody assumed that it must be the planet that Lowell had predicted.\"\r\n\r\nAt the time of the discovery of Pluto, the [*New York Times*](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/07/science/space/march-30-1930-pluto-is-discovered.html) suggested that Pluto is \"possibly larger than Jupiter.\" We now know that Pluto is 145,000 times less massive than Jupiter.", "date": null, "linkUrl": null, "source": null, "text": null, "timecode": "02:31", "title": null, "category": "note"}, {"__typename": "Footnote", "author": null, "annotation": "> \"So in 2003, I discovered what was at the time the most distant known object in the entire solar system.\"\r\n\r\nI write about the excitement surrounding the discovery of Sedna in my 2010 memoir [*How I Killed Pluto and Why It Had It Coming*](https://www.amazon.com/How-Killed-Pluto-Why-Coming/dp/0385531109).", "date": null, "linkUrl": null, "source": null, "text": null, "timecode": "03:52", "title": null, "category": "note"}, {"__typename": "Footnote", "author": null, "annotation": "> \"But my colleagues, Chad Trujillo and Scott Sheppard, did a better job, and they have now found several objects with orbits like Sedna, which is super exciting.

When they realized it was clustered in argument of perihelion, they immediately jumped up and down, saying it must be caused by a distant, giant planet out there, which is really exciting, except it makes no sense at all.\"\r\n\r\nSheppard and Trujillo's original paper [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature13156) tries to make the case for a planet, but they could not find a way to make a planet cluster multiple objects in argument of perihelion.
