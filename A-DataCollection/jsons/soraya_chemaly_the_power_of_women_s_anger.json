Researchers continue to advocate for more and better investigations into the relationship between emotional regulation and physical health. While anger -- its expression and/or suppression -- does not directly cause specific illnesses and pain, it is now understood as an important contributor and mitigating factor. For example, emotional suppression, often specifically the suppression of anger, can affect patients' ability to manage pain and recover from illness. Some of this research can be found in three heavily-footnoted chapters (Chapters 3, 4 and 5) of my book, [*Rage Becomes Her: The Power of Women's Anger*](https://www.amazon.com/Rage-Becomes-Her-Power-Womens/dp/1501189565/).", "date": null, "linkUrl": null, "source": null, "text": null, "timecode": "08:10", "title": null, "category": "note"}, {"__typename": "Footnote", "author": null, "annotation": "> \"Some studies even indicate that it affects mortality rates, particularly in black women with cancer.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the effects of suppressing emotion are associated with worse survival consistently across race/ethnicity and stage of disease, some research indicates that black women are more likely to heavily rely on suppressing emotions, contributing to higher mortality. \r\n\r\nReynolds, P et al.

For example, one [national field experiment](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/1467-9280.01433) by Lerner, J. S., Gonzalez, R. M., Small, D. A. and Fischhoff, B. (2003) found that experiencing more anger triggered more optimistic beliefs; in another [experiment](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1080/10781919.2010.487862) by Eran Halperin (2011), experimentally inducing anger led to increased support for political compromise. In their qualitative book, [*The Anger Advantage*](https://www.amazon.com/Anger-Advantage-Surprising-Benefits-Change/dp/0767911601), Deborah Cox, Karin H. Bruckner and Sally Staub also include a chapter on anger and intimacy, as well as one on anger in the family. In both they refer to the need to understand, express and acknowledge anger as positive contributor to better relationships and enhanced intimacy as part of those improved relationships.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [research](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fpspp0000157) conducted by Ford, B. Q., Lam, P., John, O. P. and Mauss, I. B. (2018) suggested that acceptance of negative emotions -- including anger -- may have multiple psychological benefits. In their [2009 study](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40587287), Valentino, N. A., Gregorowicz, K. and Groenendyk, E. W. found that anger is part of a critical feedback loop between political efficacy and political engagement and behavior.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted, as well, that there are some limits to anger's benefits. One [study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002210311100148X?via%3Dihub) by Baas, M., De Dreu, C. K. W. and Nijstad, B. A. (2011), which focused on creativity tasks, found that angry individuals initially performed those tasks better than those who were sad or mood-neutral. However, over time those angry individuals highlighted a steeper decline in creative performance than those other individuals.", "date": null, "linkUrl": null, "source": null, "text": null, "timecode": "10:10", "title": null, "category": "note"}]}}}, "commentsEnabled": false, "commentsLoggedInOnly": false}, "language": "en", "messages": {}, "responseCode": 200, "__N_SSP": true}
