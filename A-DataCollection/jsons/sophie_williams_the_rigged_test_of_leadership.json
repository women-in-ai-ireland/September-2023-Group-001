As this study shows, the impact of this bias can be really clearly shown by the fact that people have an increased tendency to think that people who are unlike them (if they hold a societally majority position) who have reached positions of success, have achieved this position because of \"special treatment.\" And so because they don\u2019t believe that their success has been earned, they are quick to dismiss that success (after all, we could all be successful if we\u2019d had the same opportunities handed to us). Studies have shown that white people tend to hold the belief that Black people who are successful, have been so at least in part due to affirmative action or positive discrimination. Men also often put women\u2019s successes down to the same. This gives them further reason to believe that not only do these people not deserve these roles, they are poorly equipped to execute them.
