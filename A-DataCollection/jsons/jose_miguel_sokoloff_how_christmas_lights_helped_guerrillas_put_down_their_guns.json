At Christmas 2010, his agency, Lowe-SSP3 Colombia, placed nine decorated holiday trees in the jungle near a banner ad that read: &quot;If Christmas can come to the jungle, you can come home. Demobilize.&quot; It won gold at Cannes Lions -- but the most important prize was that it succeeded in its intent, creating a spike in demobilization rates.<br />&nbsp;<br />The following year the agency planned a poetic campaign called &quot;Rivers of Light&quot; (Operaci&oacute;n R&iacute;os de Luz), which floated a raft of glowing plastic balls, filled with gifts and messages from family, down rivers that the revolutionaries typically travel. Christmas 2012&#39;s campaign, &quot;Operation Bethlehem,&quot; lit up wayfinding &quot;stars&quot; over local villages, offering defectors a route back.<br />&nbsp;<br />Meanwhile, Sokoloff&#39;s agency also handles large global consumer clients like Unilever, as well as the Colombian newspaper<em> El Espectador.</em>", "slug": "jose_miguel_sokoloff"}]}, "description": "\"In my lifetime, I have never lived one day of peace in my country,\" says Jose Miguel Sokoloff.
