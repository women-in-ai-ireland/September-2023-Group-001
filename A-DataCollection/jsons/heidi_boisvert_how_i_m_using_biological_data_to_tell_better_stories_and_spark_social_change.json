It might be blocking an ability to be receptive to perspective taking, to change. I draw from various empirical studies catalogued in Nicholas Carr's muckraking book [*The Shallows,*](https://www.amazon.com/Shallows-What-Internet-Doing-Brains/dp/0393339750) as well as other empirical studies to reveal how the internet clogs working memory and decreases the ability to empathize with others (it disallows synaptic terminals to form in the frontal lobe, which serves to truncate explicit memory consolidation). \r\n\r\nA study conducted by a team of researchers at Xidian University in Shanghai from 2011 was also informative. They monitored the effects of long-term Internet addiction on microstructures of the adolescent brain using \"diffusion tensor imaging\" on the adolescent brain. Their findings reveal that changes to the gray matter volume of the prefrontal cortex, the supplementary motor area, the orbitofrontal cortex, the cerebellum and the left rostral contribute to chronic dysfunction of its subjects: impairment of psychological well-being, academic failure and reduced work performance. The very regions effected correspond closely to cognitive control; specifically, the internet impacts motivational stimuli, reward pathways and the selection of appropriate behavior as a result of deficits tied to working memory.\r\n\r\nKai Yuan et al., [\"Microstructure Abnormalities in Adolescents with Internet Addiction Disorder\"](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0020708), *PLOS One* (2011).", "date": null, "linkUrl": null, "source": null, "text": null, "timecode": "01:04", "title": null, "category": "note"}, {"__typename": "Footnote", "author": null, "annotation": "> \"In fact, our dependence upon the web and mobile devices might be taking over our cognitive and affective faculties, rendering us socially and emotionally incompetent, and I felt complicit in this dehumanization.\"\r\n\r\nInformed in part by a study by UCLA scientists that showed the rise of social-emotional incompetence in young people as a result of less face-to-face time.

Rather than devising tools to \"command and control\" the brain, British cyberneticists took a non-dualistic approach to experimenting with the brain's complex, performative structure to model other things, such as creating adaptive electro-mechanical devices, most notably Walter's tortoises and Ashby's homeostats, considered antecedents of today's responsive interaction design.\r\n\r\nAndrew Pickering, [*The Cybernetic Brain: Sketches of Another Future,*](https://www.amazon.com/Cybernetic-Brain-Sketches-Another-Future-dp-0226667901/dp/0226667901) University of Chicago Press (2011).", "date": null, "linkUrl": null, "source": null, "text": null, "timecode": "01:57", "title": null, "category": "note"}, {"__typename": "Footnote", "author": null, "annotation": "> \"Matching people's TV preferences with their views on social justice issues reveals that Americans who rank immigration among their top three concerns are more likely to be fans of \"The Walking Dead,\" and they often watch for the adrenaline boost, which is measurable.\"\r\n\r\nThis example stems from the findings of a recent survey conducted by futurePerfect lab with the Norman Lear Center's Media Impact Project, entitled [\"Are You What You Watch?
