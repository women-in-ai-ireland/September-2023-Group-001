He was born in Guatemala, but when his father received threats from a death squad, his family left for the United States. It was 1980 and Peccerelli was 9. He quickly adapted to life in Brooklyn, New York. But in 1994, while a college student, he heard a presentation on the emerging field of forensic anthropology. The speakers talked about exhuming bodies from mass graves in Guatemala, and Peccerelli was fascinated. He wanted to help.</p> <p class=\"p3\">Peccerelli founded the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.fafg.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Guatemalan Forensic Anthropology Foundation</a>, which meets with the families of the &ldquo;disappeared,&rdquo; listens to their stories and takes DNA samples to match to exhumed bodies. In this way, they are able to piece together narratives of what happened &mdash; in order to give families closure and to provide evidence for the trials of those involved in the deaths.&nbsp;</p> <p class=\"p3\">Pecerrelli has been profiled on&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/pov/discoveringdominga/special_evidence_fp.php\" target=\"_blank\">PBS</a>,&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/30/science/conversation-with-fredy-peccerelli-bones-tell-story-revealing-history-s-darker.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The New York Times</em></a>&nbsp;and more.
