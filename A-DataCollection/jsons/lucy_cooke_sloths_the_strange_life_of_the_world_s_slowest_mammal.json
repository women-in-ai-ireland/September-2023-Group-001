Their rainforest home is disappearing fast and as urban areas expand a growing number of sloths are falling victim to electrocutions, road traffic collisions, domestic dog attacks and human cruelty. The sloths in this talk were photographed at sanctuaries in Central America, which are a great place for tourists to see sloths. But not all sanctuaries release their sloths back into the wild, and many offer the opportunity to hug or hold a sloth, which causes these strange creatures dangerous amounts of stress. Please say no to \"sloth selfies\" and only visit sanctuaries that have scientifically supported rehab and release programs for their sloths. I recommend the following organizations (where these photos were taken):\r\n\r\n[The Toucan Rescue Ranch](https://toucanrescueranch.org/), San Jose, Costa Rica\r\n[The Jaguar Rescue Center](http://www.jaguarrescue.foundation/), Puerto Viejo, Costa Rica\r\n[APPC](http://www.appcpanama.org/), Gamboa, Panama\r\n\r\nFor more information on sloth conservation, I recommend the following organizations:\r\n\r\nThe Zoological Society of London's [EDGE campaign](https://www.edgeofexistence.org/projects/saving-pygmy-sloth-extinction/) are working to protect the two species of sloth listed as endangered.\r\n\r\n[The Sloth Institute](http://www.theslothinstitutecostarica.org/) and [Sloth Conservation Foundation](https://slothconservation.com/) are two organizations working in Costa Rica to protect the sloths and their environment.

An average is the feat of a male, not particularly vigorous, which swam sixty-five feet to the nearest bush on shore in two and a half minutes. This is one foot in two and a third seconds.\"\r\n\r\nSo, either Goffart has quoted Beebe wrong, or he has listed the wrong sources for his information. We cannot tell, but another source of information is this curious study made by S.W. Britton and R.F.

Retractor muscles have a variety of functions that are important to sloths, including helping them cling, hold and pull things towards them.\r\n\r\nCraig Holdrege notes on page 135-6 of [*Beyond Biotechnology: The Barren Promise of Genetic Engineering*](https://open.spotify.com/track/5djKvDxjAywbUAFlduFngq?si=j3gjx8XETci9eNKkzAqD3g):\r\n\r\n\"Muscles work by means of contraction. While clinging, for example, some muscles in the limbs -- the retractor muscle -- are contracted (think of your biceps) while other muscles -- the extensor muscles -- are relaxed (think of your triceps). When a limb is extended (when the sloth reaches out to a branch) the extensor muscles contract, while the retractor muscles relax. All movement involves a rhythmical interplay between retractor and extensor muscles. It is revealing that most of a sloth's skeletal musculature is made up of retractor muscles (Goffart 1971; Mendel 1985a). These are the muscles of the extremities that allow an animal to hold and cling to things and also to pull things towards it. Its extensor muscles are smaller and fewer in number. In fact, significant extensor muscles in other mammals are modified in the sloth and serve as retractor muscles.

Two-toed sloths either defecate from the canopy or on the ground, especially when switching trees, and have a less constrained routine than three-toed sloths.\r\n\r\nFor more on these defecation habits, and the relationship between sloth fur and algae, see Pauli J.N., et al., [\"A syndrome of mutualism reinforces the lifestyle of a sloth\"](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2013.3006), *Proceedings of the Royal Society*, 2014", "date": null, "linkUrl": null, "source": null, "text": null, "timecode": "09:56", "title": null, "category": "note"}, {"__typename": "Footnote", "author": null, "annotation": "> \"... sloths are generally silent, solitary creatures, except for when the female is in heat.

However, when you are a slow mover without much energy to spare, finding a mate can be difficult. Female three-fingered sloths have found an unexpected solution to the problem -- they scream! When she enters estrus (becomes fertile), a female will emit high-pitched vocalisations to attract the attention of males. She will do this for eight to ten days every single month with the vocalizations increasing in frequency until she is screaming every 10-15 minutes. Upon hearing this noise, male sloths will respond by moving through the canopy toward her. If they encounter another male along the way, they will fight over access to the female ... Sloths can survive huge falls to the forest floor, but the weaker male will often surrender before it reaches this point by emitting a high pitched squeal.\"\r\n\r\nFor more on sloth reproduction and biology in general, I thoroughly recommend reading the rest of Dr. Cliffe's book *Sloths: Life in the Slow Lane*.\r\n\r\nIt was also William Beebe who deduced that the noise emitted by sloths was D-sharp and mimics the sound of a Kiskadee flycatcher. He writes: \"There is little difference in tone or timbre of the cry of a new born sloth or fully adult sloths of either sex. It is a plaintive, shrill, penetrating whistle, beginning on D-sharp middle C and holding true for several seconds.\"\r\n\r\nHe goes on to say: \"It is very similar to the ordinary call-note of the small-billed Kiskadee flycatcher, *Pitangus lictor* (Licht.), and I have been deceived many times and gone to the sloth enclosure to see what was the matter when it was only one of these birds calling from a neighboring tree. Of still greater interest is the reaction of sloths themselves to this birdnote. Three separate times I have seen one, five and two sloths respectively, raise their heads and gaze intently in the general direction of the flycatcher, very evidently deceived by the resemblance.\"\r\n\r\nFor more on sloth noises, see Beebe, W., [\"The Three-toed Sloth\"](https://ia601208.us.archive.org/16/items/zoologicasci719231931newy/zoologicasci719231931newy.pdf), *Zoologica : scientific contributions of the New York Zoological Society*, 1926", "date": null, "linkUrl": null, "source": null, "text": null, "timecode": "10:50", "title": null, "category": "note"}, {"__typename": "Footnote", "author": null, "annotation": "> \"I think scented messages in her dung will help send Romeo up the right tree so that he doesn't waste precious energy scaling the wrong one.\"\r\n\r\nThis theory was originated by Dr. Rebecca Cliffe after observing the behavior of wild male sloths around the dung of female sloths in heat, and the frequency of defecation of female sloths when in heat.

As she notes on page 62 of *The Truth About Animals*, \"Why and how they are capable of bouncing back after horrible injuries is still a bit of a mystery.\"\r\n\r\nA conversation with Professor Enrique Amaya of the University of Manchester, who specializes in gene expression and limb regeneration in gecko lizards, provided her with a fascinating lead. \"When a gecko needs to regrow its tail, it enters what he calls an 'embryonic state' -- basically, it lowers its metabolic rate in order to put all of its energy into healing.\" She suspected that the sloth's low metabolic rate might work in a similar fashion, but so far she hasn't been able to back up her hypothesis with experimental evidence.\"\r\n\r\nThe sloth's low metabolism has been credited by some researchers with protecting it from cancer and for evolution altering its neck length without any of the side effects seen for other mammals.\r\n\r\nFor more, see Varela-Lasheras, I., et al., [\"Breaking Evolutionary and Pleiotropic Constraints in Mammals: On Sloths, Manatees and Homeotic Mutations\"](https://evodevojournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2041-9139-2-11), *EvoDevo*, 2011", "date": null, "linkUrl": null, "source": null, "text": null, "timecode": "12:14", "title": null, "category": "note"}, {"__typename": "Footnote", "author": null, "annotation": "> \"... we now think that a low metabolism may well be key to surviving extinction. Researchers at Kansas University who were studying mollusks found that a high metabolism predicted which species of mollusk had gone extinct.\"\r\n\r\nClarification: This study was performed by researchers affiliated with the University of Kansas and Oxford University. While it does suggest that a low metabolism may be a key evolutionary predictor, it's important to clarify that this is very early days for this research. As the researchers note themselves, it was a limited taxonomic sample and a restricted time period, and their studies only show that slow metabolism can be a predictor of extinction.\r\n\r\nFor more, see Strotz L.C., et al., [\"Metabolic rates, climate and macroevolution: a case study using Neogene molluscs\"](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2018.1292), *Proceedings of the Royal Society*, 2018", "date": null, "linkUrl": null, "source": null, "text": null, "timecode": "12:36", "title": null, "category": "note"}]}}}, "commentsEnabled": false, "commentsLoggedInOnly": false}, "language": "en", "messages": {}, "responseCode": 200, "__N_SSP": true}
