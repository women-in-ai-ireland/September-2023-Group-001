While moonlighting as an airline pilot, Strickland founded Manchester Bidwell, a world-class institute in his native Pittsburgh devoted to vocational instruction in partnership with big business -- and, almost incidentally, home to a Grammy-winning record label and a world-class jazz performance series. Yet its emphasis on the arts is no accident, as it embodies Strickland&#39;s conviction that an atmosphere of high culture and respect will energize even the most troubled students. <br /><br />With job placement rates that rival most universities, Manchester Bidwell&#39;s success has attracted the attention of everyone from George Bush, Sr. (who appointed Strickland to a six-year term on the board of the NEA) to Fred Rogers (who invited Strickland to demonstrate pot throwing on <em>Mister Rogers&#39; Neighborhood</em>). In 2010, President Obama appointed Strickland to the White House Council  for Community Solutions, which oversees volunteering and community  service on a local and national level. And though cumbersome slide trays have been replaced by PowerPoint, the inspirational power of his speeches and slide shows are the stuff of lecture circuit legend.</p>", "slug": "bill_strickland"}]},
