Lipstadt, Dorot professor of Holocaust Studies at Emory University in Atlanta, was sued for libel in 1996 by David Irving for having called him a Holocaust denier. After a ten-week trial in London in 2000, in an overwhelming victory for Lipstadt, the judge found Irving to be a &quot;neo-Nazi polemicist&quot; who &quot;perverts&quot; history and engages in &quot;racist&quot; and &quot;anti-Semitic&quot; discourse. <em>The Daily Telegraph</em> (London) described the trial as having &quot;done for the new century what the Nuremberg tribunals or the Eichmann trial did for earlier generations.&quot; <em>The Times</em> (London) described it as &quot;history has had its day in court and scored a crushing victory.&quot; According to the <em>New York Times</em>, the trial &quot;put an end to the pretense that Mr. Irving is anything but a self-promoting apologist for Hitler.&quot;</p><p>The movie&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4645330/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Denial</em></a>, starring Rachel Weisz and Tom Wilkenson with a screenplay by David Hare, tells the story of this legal battle. &nbsp;It is based on Lipstadt&#39;s book,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/0GkN\" target=\"_blank\"><em>History on Trial: My Day in Court with a Holocaust Denier</em></a>&nbsp;(Harper Collins, 2006), and recently reissued as&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/EsUz4Hz\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Denial</em></a>&nbsp;(Harper Collins, 2016).
