the writing about genetic modification (GM) and biotechnology (aka genetic engineering) focuses on plant biotechnology, largely because there are as yet no GM animals either in agriculture or in environmental applications, such as the mosquito control application described in my talk. Yet the principles, history and politics of crop biotechnology provide a good background for the reader seeking to understand both the basics and the controversies. Modern methods of genetic modifications and the GMOs produced using them have evoked an unprecedented level of societal controversy. Individuals and organizations opposed to using biotechnology have made effective use of scare tactics, with the result that there is a general perception throughout the world that there's something bad about GMOs. Indeed, a recent Pew poll revealed that even though almost 90 percent of scientists had a positive view of GMOs, that view was shared by less than 40 percent of the public. The curious reader, then, has the tough task of recognizing his or her own beliefs about GMOs, figuring out whether they comport with the scientific consensus, and, if so inclined, reconstructing them on a foundation of up-to-date science.

With former Secretary of Agriculture Jack Block, she recently published a <em>New York Times</em> editorial titled &quot;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/06/opinion/mosquito-vs-mosquito-in-the-battle-over-the-zika-virus.html\" target=\"_blank\">Mosquito vs. Mosquito in the Battle Over the Zika Virus</a>.&quot;</p><p>Fedoroff was trained as a molecular biologist and geneticist at the Rockefeller University in New York City. The university awarded her an honorary doctorate in 2008 as one of its most distinguished alumni on the occasion of its 50th anniversary.</p><p>Fedoroff&#39;s early scientific accomplishments include analyzing a curious enzyme that replicates the RNA genome of a tiny RNA virus and sequencing of one the first genes ever to be sequenced. On the strength of this work, she was appointed a member of the scientific staff of the Carnegie Institution for Science&rsquo;s Department of Embryology. Her most important contributions began when she met the legendary biologist&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nap.edu/read/4990/chapter/11/\" target=\"_blank\">Barbara McClintock</a>&nbsp;in 1978. She was intrigued by McClintock&rsquo;s pioneering work on transposable elements, commonly known as &quot;jumping genes,&quot; in corn plants.</p><p>McClintock&#39;s work was purely genetic, hence Fedoroff set out to study her jumping genes at the molecular level. That meant figuring out how to clone plant genes, none of which had yet been cloned. In fact, people had begun to wonder whether plant genes could be cloned at all. Solving the technical problems, Fedoroff and her students unraveled the molecular details of how these mobile DNA sequences move and how the plants exert epigenetic control of their movement. This work led to her election to the National Academy of Sciences in 1990. Her capstone book on transposable elements entitled&nbsp;<em><a href=\"http://geni.us/p5kzScG\" target=\"_blank\">Plant Transposons and Genome Dynamics in Evolution</a>&nbsp;,</em>was published in 2013.</p><p>Fedoroff moved the Penn State University in 1995 as the Director of the Biotechnology Institute and Vern M. Willaman Chair in Life Sciences. Here she organized a multidisciplinary graduate and research program now known as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.huck.psu.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Huck Institute of the Life Sciences</a>. Her laboratory research shifted to understanding how plants respond to stress and how they process small regulatory RNAs from larger precursors. She also began to dance Argentine tango. And she wrote a book with science writer Nancy Marie Brown titled&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/DEamyA\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Mendel in the Kitchen: A Scientist&rsquo;s View of Genetically Modified Foods</em></a>.</p><p>The year 2007 was marked by two extraordinary events in Fedoroff&#39;s life. She was named a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nationalmedals.org/laureates/nina-v-fedoroff/\" target=\"_blank\">National Medal of Science</a>&nbsp;laureate for 2006 and she was appointed as the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://science.psu.edu/news-and-events/2007-news/Fedoroff7-2007-2.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Science and Technology Adviser to the Secretary of State</a>&nbsp;by then-Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice. The science advisory position gave her an unexpected bully pulpit to talk about the importance of science in diplomacy, about which she was&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/19/science/19conv.html/\" target=\"_blank\">interviewed</a>&nbsp;by Claudia Dreifus of the <em>New York Times</em>. It also gave her many opportunities to talk about genetic modification and GMOs all over the world. Realizing that development efforts would benefit from increased involvement of scientists, she organized the GKI, an NGO that builds collaborative networks around problems requiring scientific and technological input.</p><p>Completing her advisory work at the State Department in 2010, Fedoroff was recruited to the new&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/\" target=\"_blank\">King Abdullah University of Science</a>&nbsp;and Technology (KAUST) as a Distinguished Professor of the Life Sciences. At KAUST, Fedoroff organized a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cda.kaust.edu.sa/Pages/Home.aspx/\" target=\"_blank\">Center for Desert Agriculture</a>, seeking to address the difficulties facing agriculture in increasingly populous dryland areas.</p><p>Today Fedoroff continues write and lecture internationally, most recently keynoting the 2017&nbsp;<a href=\"https://us.eventbu.com/mantua/food-science-festival-mantova-5-6-7-maggio-2017/2665190.amp/\" target=\"_blank\">Mantua Food and Science Festival</a>&nbsp;in Mantua, Italy.

EPA has a [website](https://www3.epa.gov/caddis/ssr_ins_int.html) that describes how different insecticides work. Insecticides are a subset of a larger set of compounds designated \"[pesticides](http://www.npic.orst.edu/ingred/ptype/index.html),\" which also includes compounds that kill plants (called herbicides) and microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi. In considering the toxicity of pesticides for humans, it is important to understand that compounds that kill insects (insecticides) are far more likely to be toxic to humans than are other kinds of pesticides for the simple reason that we, like insects, are animals.\r\n\r\nPenn State\u2019s [Pesticide Education website](http://extension.psu.edu/pests/pesticide-education/applicators/fact-sheets/pesticide-safety/potential-health-effects-of-pesticides) is a useful resource. The commonly used measure of toxicity is the LD50, which is the amount, measured in milligrams/kilogram body weight, that has a 50% probability of killing the organism. So if the LD50 is exactly the same for an insect and for a human, it would take roughly 150,000 times more insecticide to kill a human than a mosquito. Nonetheless, these are toxic compounds and it is important for people applying these compounds, such as those shown in the photographs, to wear protective gear and use gas masks to prevent inhalation.", "date": null, "linkUrl": null, "source": null, "text": null, "timecode": "05:52", "title": null, "category": "note"}, {"__typename": "Footnote", "author": null, "annotation": "**Insecticides are non-selective.** With few exceptions, insecticides don\u2019t discriminate between insects that are beneficial, whether it be for people or for either agriculture or the broader ecosystem, and insects that are harmful, whether it be for agriculture, wildlife, or people.  This point was well illustrated by the [kill-off of bees](http://thescienceexplorer.com/nature/millions-honeybees-have-been-killed-spray-intended-prevent-zika-virus) during aerial spraying of the insecticide Naled to control mosquitoes in Dorchester County, South Carolina in September of 2016.\r\n\r\n**Insecticide-resistance is inevitable.** Protracted insecticide use is self-defeating because it inevitably selects for insecticide-resistant insects.  This is because biological organisms are constantly changing genetically both because of the chemistry of DNA, their genetic material, and because of natural radiation that bombards the earth.  Even if a mutation that confers insecticide resistance occurs very rarely, the repeated use of an insecticide to kill off all the insecticide-sensitive insects in the neighborhood will eventually allow that rare mutant insect to survive and continue reproducing.\r\n\r\nBrogdon, William G., and Janet C.

As an example, she recounted the story of how screwworm ([*Cochliomyia hominivorax*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochliomyia_hominivorax)), which once caused millions of dollars of losses to the livestock industry, was eradicated during the 20th century. Screwworm is a particularly nasty insect pest that affects wild animals, agricultural animals, pets and people. Females lay eggs on open wounds, where they hatch quickly. The larvae crawl into the wound to feed on the living flesh and body fluids. This makes the wound worse, attracting more females to lay their eggs near it.

Serendipitously, Knipling was given a copy of Nobel laureate H. J. Muller\u2019s book \u201cDrosophila\u201d by a colleague.  Muller was the geneticist who discovered that X-rays could produce genetic changes (mutations) in Drosophila, the humble fruitfly, built the foundation of modern genetics.  \r\n\r\nToo much irradiation, however, and the flies were sterile.  Knipling and Bushland wondered whether irradiated, sterile screwworms could still mate. They secured the cooperation of a nearby U. S. Army medical unit with suitable X-ray equipment and soon figured out that irradiated screwworm pupae (the cocoon stage of insect\u2019s development) could grow into sterile adults that could mate normally, but produced no offspring.\r\n\r\nThe first successful large-scale tests releasing sterile insects were conducted in 1951 on Sanibel Island near Ft. Meyers and then, in 1954, screwworms were eradicated from the island of Cura\u00e7ao in the Antilles within 6 months. Next the insects were knocked back by 90% in southern Florida in 3 months. \r\n\r\nA new sterile fly rearing facility was built in Florida and was soon producing more than 50 million flies per week.  The flies were packed in boxes and distributed from small planes over Florida, southern Georgia and southern Alabama.  New rearing facilities were added and the eradication program expanded to Texas, New Mexico and then Arizona and California through the 1960s, with more than 200 million flies being released weekly.\r\n\r\nBut despite local successes, the flies were reinvading from Mexico. A joint program with Mexico was established in 1972 and a new rearing facility built in southern Mexico. The last cases of screwworm in California, Arizona and New Mexico were reported in 1979 and the program began to be phased out in the U.S.  By the end of 1985, most of Mexico was screwworm-free and the eradication program had moved farther south to Guatemala and Belize, which are now free of the pest, as well.", "date": null, "linkUrl": null, "source": null, "text": null, "timecode": "07:30", "title": null, "category": "note"}, {"__typename": "Footnote", "author": null, "annotation": "**Fedoroff and Block editorial: \"[Mosquito vs. mosquito in the battle over the Zika virus](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/06/opinion/mosquito-vs-mosquito-in-the-battle-over-the-zika-virus.html?_r=0).\"** New York Times, 6 April 2016\r\n\r\n**Can sterile insect technology be used to control mosquitoes?**\r\n\r\nThis exact approach, the technical term for which is \u201csterile insect technology (SIT)\u201d has been tried a number of times for mosquitoes, but has not proved very effective to date, although efforts to develop it continues.
