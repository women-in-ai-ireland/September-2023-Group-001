He has been named \u201cBest Weatherman\u201d twice by <em>New York</em> magazine, is a recipient of the American Meteorological Society's prestigious Seal of Approval and has been a pioneer in the use of computer graphics for weathercasting. In 1994, he founded the multimedia company Al Roker Entertainment. Over the past 30 years they've been producing socially impactful stories across platforms from network broadcast and cable to digital, OTT and beyond.
