In the same way that optical illusions fool our eyes -- and fool everyone&#39;s eyes in the same way -- Gilbert argues that <strong>our brains systematically misjudge what will make us happy</strong>. And these quirks in our cognition make humans very poor predictors of our own bliss.<br /><br />The premise of his current research -- that our assumptions about what will make us happy are often wrong -- is supported with clinical research drawn from psychology and neuroscience. But his delivery is what sets him apart. His engaging -- and often hilarious -- style pokes fun at typical human behavior and invokes pop-culture references everyone can relate to. This winning style translates also to Gilbert&#39;s writing, which is <strong>lucid, approachable and laugh-out-loud funny</strong>. The immensely readable <em><a href=\"http://www.randomhouse.com/kvpa/gilbert/\" target=\"_blank\">Stumbling on Happiness</a>,</em> published in 2006, became a <em>New York Times</em> bestseller and has been translated into 20 languages.<br /><br />In fact, the title of his book could be drawn from his own life. At 19, he was a high school dropout with dreams of writing science fiction. When a creative writing class at his community college was full, he enrolled in the only available course: psychology. He found his passion there, earned a doctorate in social psychology in 1985 at Princeton, and has since won a Guggenheim Fellowship and the Phi Beta Kappa teaching prize for his work at Harvard. He has written essays and articles for <em>The New York Times, Time</em> and even <a href=\"http://wjh-www.harvard.edu/~dtg/STARBUCKS%20CUP.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Starbucks</a>, while <strong>continuing his research into happiness at his <a href=\"http://wjh-www.harvard.edu/~dtg/gilbert.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Hedonic Psychology Laboratory</a>.</strong></p>", "slug": "dan_gilbert"}]}, "description": "Dan Gilbert presents research and data from his exploration of happiness -- sharing some surprising tests and experiments that you can also try on yourself.
