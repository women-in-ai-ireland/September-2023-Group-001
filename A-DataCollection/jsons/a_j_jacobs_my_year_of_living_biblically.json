Jacobs&#39;s writings stand at the intersection of philosophy, Gonzo journalism and performance art. Stubbornly curious and slyly perceptive, he takes immersive learning to its irrational and profoundly amusing extreme -- extracting wisdom and meaning after long stints as a self-styled guinea pig. For his <a href=\"http://blog.ted.com/2005/09/aj_jacobs_rocks.php\" target=\"_blank\">widely circulated</a> <em>Esquire</em> article, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.esquire.com/ESQ0905OUTSOURCING_214\" target=\"_blank\">My Outsourced Life</a>,&quot; he explored the phenomenon of outsourcing by hiring a team in Bangalore to take care of every part of his life -- from reading his emails to arguing with his wife to reading bedtime stories to his own son. A previous article, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.esquire.com/features/honesty0707\" target=\"_blank\">I Think You&#39;re Fat</a>,&quot; chronicled a brief, cringe-inducing attempt to live his life in Radical Honesty, telling all the truth, all the time. </p><p>Jacobs is author of <em><a href=\"http://geni.us/theknowitall\" target=\"_blank\">The Know-It-All</a></em>, which documents the year he spent reading the <em>Encyclopedia Britannica </em>from A to Z, uncovering both funny and surprising factoids but also poignant insight into history and human nature. In 2007 he released&nbsp;<em><a href=\"http://geni.us/yearoflivingbiblically\" target=\"_blank\">The Year of Living Biblically</a></em>, in which he attempted to follow every single rule in the Bible as literally as possible for an entire year. His book<em>&nbsp;</em><em><a href=\"http://geni.us/guineapigdiaries\" target=\"_blank\">The Guinea Pig Diaries: My Life as an Experiment</a>&nbsp;</em>is a collection of numerous personal experiments, including living according to George Washington&#39;s rules of conduct, outsourcing every single task to India and posing as a woman on an online dating site. Jacobs recently released a new book,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Thanks-Thousand-Gratitude-Journey-Books/dp/1501119923\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Thanks A Thousand: A Gratitude Journey</em></a>, which relates his life-altering journey&nbsp;to thank every single person involved in producing his morning cup of coffee.</p>", "slug": "a_j_jacobs"}]}, "description": "Author, philosopher, prankster and journalist A.J.
