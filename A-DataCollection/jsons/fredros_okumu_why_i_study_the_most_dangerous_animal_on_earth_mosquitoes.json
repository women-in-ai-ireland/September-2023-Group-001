It should be noted that these accomplishments occurred at a time when health system structure was at infancy in the area, the number of tools available for control was limited -- and so was the available expertise. Moreover, most malaria experts of the day did not think the strategy adopted by the Brazil team would succeed. Another important lesson from this book is that the team relied on accurate assessments of the biology of the mosquitoes, and effectively went after it with absolute focus. If this could be done in Brazil in 1930s, we should be confident that local elimination of certain vector species by 2030 is an achievable target in several parts of Africa. At the end of this book, the writers described several opportunities for doing deploying similar approaches in Africa, which we can learn from.

One of the points raised by Juma is what happens when there is distrust between developers and the public regarding the new technologies -- but also why \"developing\" countries sometimes choose to take precautionary approaches, with protracted approval procedures. In the end, Prof. Juma encourages political leaders, scientists, technology developers and entrepreneurs to engage proactively so that genuinely effective and desirable technologies are midwifed and brought to the forefront.

The current developers of gene drive for suppressing Anopheles populations have stated repeatedly that their intention is not to eliminate the species but to drive the populations so low that they can no longer sustain local malaria transmission. I am in agreement with that approach. It should also be noted that even if local elimination were to happen, it is likely going to be temporary, and the species can rebound afterwards. Most important, I encourage all readers and viewers to consider both the benefits of the technology and potential disadvantages. In my initial comments, I referred to WHO report 2016, which indicated 429,000 deaths annually.
