In India, inspired by Ghandi&#39;s philosophy, he began to think about the role of the schoolteacher in creating a more peaceful world. <br /><br />As his online biography says: &quot;Accepting the reality of violence, he would seek to incorporate ways to explore harmony in various situations. This exploration would take form in the framework of a game &ndash; something that students would enjoy. Within the game data space, they would be challenged, while enhancing collaborative and communication skills.&quot;<br /><br />In 1978, at the Richmond Community High School, Hunter led the first sessions of his <a href=\"http://theworldpeacegame.com/\" target=\"_blank\">World Peace Game</a>, a hands-on political simulation.
