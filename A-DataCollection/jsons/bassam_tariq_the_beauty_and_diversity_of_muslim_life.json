Phrases like African-American, Asian-American, Hispanic-American, etc., are bureaucratic words that do not hold within them the revolutionary aspirations and histories of a people (categorized but not controlled). I prefer words like black, desi, Latino, Chicano, because these words raise associations of struggles, such as the Black Power movement (Black is Beautiful, etc.), the Chicano struggles of the farm workers, of La Raza, and what not. Desi seems to be a similar word, one filled with so much historical emotion. And again, it is an ironic word because it means 'of the homeland,' but it does not say what that homeland is. We who use it do not harken back to the homeland of the subcontinent, because we are generally not nationalistic in that sense. Our homeland is an imaginary one that stretches from Jackson Heights to the Ghadar Party, from the rallies against Dotbusters to the Komagata Maru, from the 1965 Immigration Act to Devon Street. This is a homeland that we can relate to and it is what makes us feel like we belong in something of a collectivity.

Mass production relies on simplicity. Of course, there is nothing wrong with market segmentation, but the problem is that a whitewashing occurs that strips away the struggle and nuances of a group when you start marketing to them.
