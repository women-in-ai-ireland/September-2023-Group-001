His research directs the implementation of consulting projects and the selection of innovative, sustainable and advanced materials to Material ConneXion&rsquo;s library. As the Executive Vice President of Research at Material ConneXion and Chief Material Scientist at SANDOW, Dent has helped hundreds of clients -- from Whirlpool and Adidas to BMW and Procter &amp; Gamble -- develop or improve their products through the use of innovative materials.&nbsp;</p><p>Prior to joining Material ConneXion, Dent held a number of research positions both in industry and academia. At Rolls Royce PLC, he specialized in turbine blades for the present generation of jet engines. He has completed postdoctoral research at Cambridge University and at the Center for Thermal Spray Research, SUNY, Stony Brook, NY. Other research projects during this period, included work for the US Navy, DARPA, NASA and the British Ministry of Defense.
