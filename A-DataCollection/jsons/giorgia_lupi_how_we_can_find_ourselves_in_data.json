Of exquisite design grace under overflowing data pressure! Data visualization is a normal part of our information diet, but only a few designers are able to achieve utmost clarity and at the same time memorable elegance. Moving seamlessly between digital and analog space, Giorgia transforms even the driest quantitative analysis into a touching moment of humanity and poetry.", "whoTheyAre": "Giorgia Lupi sees beauty in data. She challenges the impersonality that data communicate, designing engaging visual narratives that re-connect numbers to what they stand for: stories, people, ideas.", "whyListen": "<p>What sets Giorgia Lupi apart is her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medium.com/@giorgialupi/data-humanism-the-revolution-will-be-visualized-31486a30dbfb\" target=\"_blank\">humanistic approach</a>&nbsp;to the world of data.</p><p><a href=\"http://giorgialupi.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Her work</a>&nbsp;frequently crosses the divide between digital, print and handcrafted representations of information: primarily,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medium.com/accurat-studio/sketching-with-data-opens-the-mind-s-eye-92d78554565\" target=\"_blank\">she draws with data</a>. She has a passion for and obsession with data, the material she uses to tell stories, and the lens through which she sees the world.</p><p>Data are often considered to be very impersonal, boring and clinical, but Lupi&#39;s work proves the opposite. She makes sense of data with a curious mind and a heterogeneous arsenal, which ranges from digital technology to exhausting and repetitive manual labor. She believes we will ultimately unlock the full potential of data only when we embrace their nature, and make them part of our lives, which will inevitably make data more human in the process.</p><p>Trained as an architect, Lupi has always been driven by opposing forces: analysis and intuition, logic and beauty, numbers and images. True to these dichotomies, in 2011 she started both her own company and studying for a PhD. She earned her ddoctorate in design at Politecnico di Milano, where she focused on information mapping, and she is now the design director and co-founder of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.accurat.nyc/\" target=\"_blank\">Accurat</a>, a global, data-driven research, design and innovation firm with offices in Milan and New York. She relocated from Italy to New York City, where she now lives.</p><p>Thanks to her work and research, Giorgia is a prominent voice in the world of data. She has spoken at numerous events, universities and institutions around the world, including the Museum of Modern Art, the Guggenheim Museum, PopTech Conference, Eyeo Festival, Fast Company Innovation by Design, New York University, Columbia University and the New York Public Library. She has been featured in major international outlets such as the <em>New York Times</em>, <em>The Guardian</em>, the <em>Washington Post</em>, NPR, BBC, <em>TIME</em>&nbsp;magazine, <em>National Geographic</em>, <em>Scientific American</em>, <em>Popular Science</em>, <em>Wired</em>, <em>Vogue</em>, <em>Vanity Fair</em>, <em>Monocle</em> and more. Her work has been exhibited at the Design Museum, the Science Museum, and Somerset House in London; the New York Hall of Science and the Storefront for Art and Architecture in New York; at the Triennale Design Museum and the Design Week in Milan, among others.</p><p>With her company, Accurat, she has worked with major international clients including IBM, Google, Microsoft, the United Nations, the World Health Organization, the World Economic Forum, the European Union, the Louis Vuitton-Moet-Hennessy Group, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, J.P. Morgan Asset Management, Unicredit Group and KPMG Advisory.</p><p>Giorgia is the&nbsp;co-author of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/p0ZC\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Dear Data</em></a>, an aspirational hand-drawn data visualization book that explores the more slippery details of daily life through data, revealing the patterns that inform our decisions and affect our relationships.</p><p>Her work is part of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medium.com/@giorgialupi/dear-data-has-been-acquired-by-moma-but-this-isnt-what-we-are-most-excited-about-bdaa3376d9db\" target=\"_blank\">permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art</a>.</p>", "slug": "giorgia_lupi"}]}, "description": "Giorgia Lupi uses data to tell human stories, adding nuance to numbers.

Dear Data is now also a beautiful [300-page hand-drawn book] (https://www.amazon.com/Dear-Data-Giorgia-Lupi/dp/1616895322/) with a foreword by Maria Popova. The original collection of postcards and sketchbooks of Dear Data was acquired as part of the permanent collection of the [Museum of Modern Art](https://medium.com/@giorgialupi/dear-data-has-been-acquired-by-moma-but-this-isnt-what-we-are-most-excited-about-bdaa3376d9db) in November 2016.

And, indeed, the \"data\" which Posavec and Lupi record are of the humanist, humanest kind \u2014 kindnesses (thanks paid, compliments received, smiles beamed at strangers), grievances (vanities, envies, self-criticisms), creaturely joys and vices (solitude savored, distractions succumbed to, beauty relished).\r\n", "date": null, "linkUrl": null, "source": null, "text": null, "timecode": "03:00", "title": null, "category": "note"}, {"__typename": "Footnote", "author": null, "annotation": "\"It was the only way to make them truly meaningful and representative of ourselves.\"\r\n\r\nFrom [Wired](https://www.wired.com/2016/09/heres-happens-two-designers-speak-infographics/): \"Despite the vast amount of quantification, *Dear Data* feels almost like an anti-quantified self-project. Lupi and Posavec aren\u2019t interested in calories, steps, or heart rate. Their project explores the more slippery details of daily life. This human-centric data is the reason why *Dear Data* doesn\u2019t read as detached self-analysis. There are insights to be found, even in the categories they chose.", "date": null, "linkUrl": null, "source": null, "text": null, "timecode": "03:30", "title": null, "category": "note"}, {"__typename": "Footnote", "author": null, "annotation": "\"I am not asking you to start drawing your personal data or to find a pen-pal across the ocean.\"\r\n\r\nThe most unexpected and heartwarming reward for us is how our project resonated with an incredibly wide and diverse range of people: with *Dear Data* we have been able to truly speak beyond the closed rooms of designers and data visualization practitioners. Since the project was made public, we have seen hundreds of postcards made by people who, after hearing our story wanted to try the process for themselves ([here](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/deardata/) and [here](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/we-asked-you-to-visualize-your-podcast-listening-and-wow-did-you-deliver/)) many seeking out their own data \"pen pals,\" and also setting their own yearly challenges to draw their data.\r\n\r\nWe are also touched by how many young children are reading their parents' *Dear Data* books and are excitedly drawing their own data. And more incredibly, teachers from grade school to university and beyond are using the *Dear Data* format to teach their students the world of data.\r\n\r\nThis analog, manual, and even imperfect way we approached data has opened the idea of data to a wider audience and made it more accessible, more understandable, and more easily relatable to people\u2019s daily lives.", "date": null, "linkUrl": null, "source": null, "text": null, "timecode": "04:00", "title": null, "category": "note"}, {"__typename": "Footnote", "author": null, "annotation": "\"What we missed - looking at them through Models and Algorithms only - is what I call Data Humanism.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I call Data Humanism is a new approach to the world of data, where we are ready to question the impersonality of a merely technical approach to data, and to begin designing ways to connect numbers to what they really stand for -- knowledge, behaviors, people. In fact, the more ubiquitous data becomes, the more we need to experiment with how to make it unique, contextual, intimate. And the way we visualize it is crucial because it is the key to translating numbers into concepts we can relate to. We must learn how to include and render the more qualitative and nuanced aspects of data, and we must experiment with how to visualize uncertainty, possible errors, and imperfections in our data. This is the only way to make data truly meaningful and representative of our human nature.
