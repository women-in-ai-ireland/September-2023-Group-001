Over the centuries, several elaborated incarnations have been shared. In a lecture, British philosopher Alan Watts translates the farmer\u2019s refrain as \"Maybe.\" You can listen to [Alan Watts](\r\nhttps://www.brainpickings.org/2015/11/06/alan-watts-swimming-headless/) tell that version on Brain Pickings. \r\n", "date": null, "linkUrl": null, "source": null, "text": null, "timecode": "00:12", "title": null, "category": "note"}, {"__typename": "Footnote", "author": null, "annotation": "> I also learned that people with her syndrome have significant developmental delays and disabilities.\r\n\r\nIn [this]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1183/) article, leading scholars in \"4p-\" (or Wolf-Hirschhorn Syndrome) outline symptoms and prognoses of the condition.\r\n", "date": null, "linkUrl": null, "source": null, "text": null, "timecode": "03:39", "title": null, "category": "note"}, {"__typename": "Footnote", "author": null, "annotation": "> We call congenital differences \"birth defects,\" as though human beings were objects on a factory line.\r\n\r\n[\"Facts about Birth Defects,\"](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/birthdefects/facts.html) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\r\n", "date": null, "linkUrl": null, "source": null, "text": null, "timecode": "09:20", "title": null, "category": "note"}, {"__typename": "Footnote", "author": null, "annotation": "> We hail a blockbuster film about a suicidal wheelchair user despite the fact that actual wheelchair users tell us that stereotype is unfair and damaging.\r\n\r\nThe 2016 Blockbuster film, *Me Before You*, received fierce criticism from disability rights activists for its portrayal of disability as a fate worse than death.

In 2012, a famous American children's hospital initially denied Amelia the right to a life-saving kidney transplant.\r\n\r\nAmelia Rivera\u2019s mother, Chrissy DiDonato, writes powerfully about the doctors\u2019 denial [here](http://wolfhirschhorn.org/2012/01/amelia/brick-walls/). \r\n\r\nAs Rivera makes clear, her family wasn\u2019t seeking a kidney from a waiting list for Amelia; they planned on finding a donor within the family. They only wanted doctors to perform the life-saving surgery. Thanks to national media coverage and an active online campaign, the children\u2019s hospital eventually reversed their decision and granted Amelia the operation. [ABC News](http://abcnews.go.com/Health/amelia-rivera-mentally-disabled-denied-kidney-transplant-childrens/story?id=15378575) followed the story over several months.
