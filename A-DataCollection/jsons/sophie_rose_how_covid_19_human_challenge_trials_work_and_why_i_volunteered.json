"TalkExtras", "footnotes": [{"__typename": "Footnote", "author": null, "annotation": "This TED Talk was recorded on October 26, 2020, prior to Pfizer's encouraging announcement that their vaccine candidate demonstrates ~90 percent efficacy. This outcome was relatively unexpected, as existing data about vaccine development shows us that 7 percent of vaccine candidates that have not yet entered human trials succeed; and of those that have progressed to human trials, only 17 percent succeed. We at 1Day Sooner believe Pfizer's announcement is extremely positive news for the global community -- both because it means we're closer to a working COVID-19 vaccine and, most importantly, because their results may entail that other leading candidates targeting the same features of the SARS-CoV-2 virus are also likely to be highly efficacious.\r\n\r\nHow does this news affect COVID-19 challenge studies? It's complicated. As advocates for research participants, we at 1Day Sooner are committed to changing our policies when merited by changing evidence, and we will be watching developments closely. For certain study designs, this news reduces the risks -- a non-inferiority challenge study that compares a 90 percent + effective vaccine to another promising candidate will be much safer than studies involving a placebo. Challenge studies might prove to necessary to demonstrate efficacy in enough vaccines to protect the entire global community in 2021, particularly if further Phase 3s prove impossible to perform as infection rates diminish.\r\n\r\nIf most candidates now in Phase 3 are as effective as Pfizer's, there will be much less vaccine development to do in 2021, which would reduce the benefits of challenge studies. The end of the pandemic for many countries may leave the false impression that this disease has been eliminated and may deplete research investment when the critical need still exists. Still, challenge trials may prove useful: for example, they can test the duration of immunity these vaccines provide and whether they reduce transmission (viral shedding) in addition to symptoms. But experts and volunteers would need to weigh those uses against a study's risks.\r\n\r\nWe will learn a great deal more in the months ahead. For now, our research team has begun modeling the benefits and risks of challenge trials in light of this recent development.
