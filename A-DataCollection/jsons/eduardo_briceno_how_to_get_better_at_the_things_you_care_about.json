zone.\"\r\n\r\nLearning Zone and Performance Zone are new terms introduced in this talk, but they are inspired by a deep line of psychology research which has studied mastery goals (aka learning goals) vs. performance goals (e.g. Nicholls, J. G. (1984). [Achievement motivation: Conceptions of ability, subjective experience, task choice, and performance](http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1984-28719-001). *Psychological Review*, 91, 328\u2013346).  One of the findings in Stanford Professor Carol Dweck\u2019s earlier research was that people in a growth mindset tend to endorse learning goals more than those in a fixed mindset do (e.g. Dweck, C. S. (1986). [Motivational processes affecting learning](http://psycnet.apa.org/buy/1987-08696-001). *American Psychologist*, 41, 1040\u20131048).  Dr. Dweck has been a pioneer in our understanding of motivation and I am very grateful for her mentorship, guidance, and feedback on the draft scripts for this talk and in my career more broadly.", "date": null, "linkUrl": null, "source": null, "text": null, "timecode": "01:00", "title": null, "category": "note"}, {"__typename": "Footnote", "author": null, "annotation": "> \"That is very different from what we do when we're in our performance zone, which is when our goal is to do something as best as we can, to execute. Then we concentrate on what we have already mastered and we try to minimize mistakes.\"\r\n\r\nPsychologists differentiate between two types of performance goals: performance-seeking (or performance-approach) goals and performance-avoidance (or performance-avoid) goals (e.g. e.g. Dweck, C. S. (1986). Motivational processes affecting learning. *American Psychologist*, 41, 1040\u20131048). Both are instantiations of the Performance Zone, but in the former we seek to perform flawlessly (e.g. get straight As) while in the latter we seek to avoid performing so as to not make mistakes or appear incompetent (e.g. not even try).  Performance-seeking goals tend to generate higher performance than performance-avoidance goals, but both forms tend to be a more brittle form of motivation than mastery goals, particularly when the underlying activity has more intrinsic value.  For simplicity, I kept this additional nuance out of this talk.\r\n\r\nFurther elaborating, when we do make mistakes in either zone it is always an opportunity to learn, and a growth mindset (the understanding that we can always improve, the subject of [my first TEDx talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pN34FNbOKXc)) is helpful in both zones.  In the Performance Zone a growth mindset helps us to stay calm because we understand that our performance does not permanently define us, and it helps us better recover from setbacks and to later identify opportunities for improvement.", "date": null, "linkUrl": null, "source": null, "text": null, "timecode": "01:23", "title": null, "category": "note"}, {"__typename": "Footnote", "author": null, "annotation": "> \"This hinders our growth, and ironically, over the long term, also our performance.\"\r\n\r\nSometimes people think of \u201clearning by doing\u201d as learning simply by being in the Performance Zone, but that is not the case.  When people engage in effective \u201clearning by doing\u201d they tend to engage in the experiential learning cycle, first proposed by John Dewey. In this model, \u201cdoing\u201d is just one of four stages, sometimes called the \u201cconcrete experience\u201d stage. After this \"doing\" stage, three Learning Zone stages follow: We observe and reflect on our experience (e.g. what went well, what was unexpected, what we could do better...), make some conclusions to generalize the lessons into understanding we can apply in future situations, and plan what we\u2019ll do differently and test the ideas in new situations.  \u201cLearning by doing\u201d could also be effectively applied by being in the Performance Zone while \u201cslicing\u201d a Learning Zone skill to work on during the performance (e.g. make an effort to do a better job at looking people in the eye while we're giving a presentation at work).", "date": null, "linkUrl": null, "source": null, "text": null, "timecode": "02:03", "title": null, "category": "note"}, {"__typename": "Footnote", "author": null, "annotation": "> \" In the learning zone, he did what Dr. Anders Ericsson calls deliberate practice.\"\r\n\r\nTechnically, Demosthenes did either what Dr. Ericsson calls \u201cdeliberate practice\u201d or what he calls \u201cpurposeful practice,\u201d depending on how established we consider to have been the methods for improvement in oratory and law at the time.  For simplicity, sometimes these terms are condensed as \u201cdeliberate practice,\u201d as I did here.

It is likely the most powerful strategy for the development of expertise in domains that have well-understood improvement techniques, but it is not the only type of Learning Zone activity.

But once we become proficient, a chronic Performance Zone doesn\u2019t lead to substantial ongoing improvement.  An unfortunate dynamic is that as novices we often experience improvement through the Performance Zone, and so we incorrectly assume that the Performance Zone is a good way to improve, but that is not the case past a basic proficiency level.
