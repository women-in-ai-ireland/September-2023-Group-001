Prior to this role, she served for two years as Special Assistant to FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg, where she advised the Commissioner and her staff on a wide range of issues, including nutrition labeling, food safety, genetically modified foods, scientific integrity, drug safety communication, direct-to-consumer genetic testing and personalized medicine.</p><p class=\"p1\">From 2003-2010, Simoncelli worked as the Science Advisor to the American Civil Liberties Union, where she guided the organization&rsquo;s responses to cutting-edge developments in science and technology that pose challenges for civil liberties. In this capacity, she spearheaded the development of ACLU&rsquo;s successful Supreme Court challenge to the patenting of human genes and advised ACLU leadership and staff on a number of other science policy issues. In 2013, Simoncelli was named by the journal <em>Nature</em> as one of &ldquo;ten people who mattered this year&rdquo; for her work with the ACLU in overturning gene patents.</p><p class=\"p1\">Simoncelli is co-author with Sheldon Krimsky of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/GeneticJustice\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Genetic Justice: DNA Data Banks, Criminal Investigations, and Civil Liberties</em></a>&nbsp;(Columbia University Press: 2010).
