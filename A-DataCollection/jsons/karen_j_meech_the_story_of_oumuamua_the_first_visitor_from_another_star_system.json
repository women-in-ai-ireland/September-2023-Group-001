Larger stars ending in core-collapse supernovae over half their mass in a relatively short time span, liberating or vaporizing all bound objects. Kuiper belt objects are likely destroyed in the supernova but Oort cloud objects are distant enough to survive. Exposure to the supernova will remove volatiles from the surface of these Oort cloud objects and release them into the surrounding ISM. However, supernovae are rare, so even if an entire Oort cloud is dried and released with every supernova this method falls short of matching the observed interstellar number density.\r\n\r\nYet the issue with drying interstellar objects through these mechanisms is timing. Unless \u2018Oumuamua is much older than our solar system, it has experienced roughly the same amount of cosmic ray exposure as the active comets in our solar system. If cosmic rays removed all of the volatiles from \u2018Oumuamua , we would expect the same of these comets, yet this is observationally not the case. Instead, \u2018Oumuamua may have been within \u201cfrying\u201d distance of a supernova.\u201d", "date": null, "linkUrl": null, "source": null, "text": null, "timecode": "10:36", "title": null, "category": "note"}, {"__typename": "Footnote", "author": null, "annotation": "> \"That's exactly what the Breakthrough Listen project did, but so far, 'Oumuamua has remained completely quiet.\"\r\n\r\nJ.
