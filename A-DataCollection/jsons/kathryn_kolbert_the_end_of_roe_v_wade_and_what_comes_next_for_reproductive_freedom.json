I was correct. Right after my argument, the justices returned to their conference room and took a vote, and seven justices voted to uphold the Pennsylvania restrictions that were at issue in the case. And then Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote a draft opinion. While he never said the magic words, that Roe is fatal, as Justice John Paul Stevens recently wrote in his memoir, the opinion effectively repudiated the central holding of Roe. Now, luckily, that opinion was never filed in 1992. At the last minute, Justice Anthony Kennedy changed his mind, and together with justices Sandra Day O'Connor and David Souter, they issued what they called a joint opinion.\"\r\n\r\nJustice Blackmun and Stevens joined Justice Kennedy, O'Connor and Souter -- in part -- to uphold the central holding of Roe, thereby prohibiting states from banning abortion before viability.
