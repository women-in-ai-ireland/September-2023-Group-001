This arrangement takes advantage of a provision in the international building code whereby multifamily buildings -- three stories or less, with no more than four units per floor -- are allowed to have a single means of egress as long as compliant \u201cemergency escape and rescue openings\u201d are provided from living spaces. This serves several ends, reducing construction costs from redundant circulation -- keeping the feel of the development in accord with surrounding single family housing and small garden apartments -- as well as providing for human-scale groupings of 11 t0 12 units, encouraging interactions between neighbors. While no elevator is required in such buildings and, as such, upper floor units are not required to be accessible, we fully implement the HUD Fair Housing Act Design Manual\u2019s requirement that all ground floor units have the required accessibility features for adaptation. Additionally, in anticipation of needing federal housing subsidies, the prototype complies with the HUD rule known colloquially as \u201cSection 504,\u201d whereby 5% of all our units follow the stricter \u201cType A\u201d requirements.
