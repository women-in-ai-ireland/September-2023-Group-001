A financial journalist turned innovation consultant (for clients ranging from the British government to Microsoft), Leadbeater noticed the rise of <strong>&quot;pro-ams&quot; -- passionate amateurs who act like professionals</strong>, making breakthrough discoveries in many fields, from software to astronomy to kite-surfing. His 2004 essay <a href=\"http://www.demos.co.uk/publications/proameconomy\" target=\"_blank\">&quot;The Pro-Am Revolution&quot;</a>   -- which <a href=\"http://nytimes.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The New York Times</em> </a> called one of the year&#39;s biggest global ideas -- highlighted the rise of this new breed of amateur. <br /><br />Prominent examples  range from the mountain bike to the open-source operating system Linux, from Wikipedia to the <a href=\"http://www.jubileedebtcampaign.org.uk/?lid=1\" target=\"_blank\">Jubilee 2000 campaign</a>, which helped persuade Western nations to cancel more than $30 billion in third-world debt. In his upcoming book, <em><a href=\"http://www.charlesleadbeater.net/orange-buttons/we-think.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">We-Think</a>,</em> <strong>Leadbeater explores how this emerging culture of mass creativity and participation could reshape companies and governments</strong>.
