What they saw: kids from the slum playing with the computer and, in the process, learning how to use it -- then teaching each other. These famed &ldquo;Hole in the Wall&rdquo; experiments demonstrated that, in the absence of supervision and formal teaching, children can teach themselves and each other -- if they&rsquo;re motivated by curiosity. Mitra, now a professor of educational technology at <a href=\"http://egwestcentre.com/research/holeinthewall/\" target=\"_blank\">Newcastle University</a>, called it &quot;minimally invasive education.&quot;</p><p>Mitra thinks self-organized learning will shape the future of education. At TED2013, he made a bold TED Prize wish: Help me build a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.ted.com/participate/ted-prize/prize-winning-wishes/school-in-the-cloud\" target=\"_blank\">School in the Cloud</a>&nbsp;where children can explore and learn on their own -- and teach one another -- using resouces from the worldwide cloud. </p><p>The School in the Cloud now includes seven physical locations -- five in India and two in the UK. At the same time, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theschoolinthecloud.org/\" target=\"_blank\">School in the Cloud online platform</a>&nbsp;lets students participate anywhere, with partner learning labs and programs&nbsp;in countries <a href=\"http://blog.ted.com/self-organized-learners-around-the-world-team-up-to-raise-money/\" target=\"_blank\">like Colombia, Pakistan and Greece</a>.
