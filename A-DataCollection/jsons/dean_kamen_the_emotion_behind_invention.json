FIRST sponsors lively annual competitions, where students form teams to create the best robot. </p><p>His focus now is on off-grid electricity and water purification for developing countries; <strong>another recent project, previewed at TED2007, is a <a href=\"http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/08/08/dean-kamen-lends-a-hand-or-two/\" target=\"_blank\">prosthetic arm</a>  for maimed soldiers (read an update <a href=\"http://spectrum.ieee.org/feb08/5957\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>).</strong> He&#39;s also working on a power source for the wonderful <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/magazines/business2/business2_archive/2007/08/01/100138830/index.htm?eref=rss_topstories\" target=\"_blank\">Think car</a>.
