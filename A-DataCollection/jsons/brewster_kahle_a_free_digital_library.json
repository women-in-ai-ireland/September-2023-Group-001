In 1982 he helped start Thinking Machines, a supercomputer company specializing in text searching, and would go on to <strong>invent the Internet&#39;s first publishing and distributed search system, WAIS</strong>, whose customers included the <em>New York Times</em> and the United States Senate.<br /><br />But most notably, perhaps, Kahle is founder and director of<strong> the Internet Archive, a free service which steadfastly archives World Wide Web documents</strong>, even as they are plowed over by breakneck trends in commerce, culture and politics. (On his Wayback Machine, you can view pages as they appeared in web antiquity -- say, Yahoo! in 1996.) As a member of the Board of Directors of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, he works to keep such information free and reachable.<br /><br />Kahle is a key supporter of the Open Content Alliance and has been elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
