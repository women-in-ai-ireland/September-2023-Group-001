We do not yet have brain imaging from people with PTSD who receive MDMA in the scanner. A study at Yale is underway to investigate. My statement reflects results published in small samples of healthy individuals administered MDMA while performing various tasks or during resting states. Conclusive evidence has not been reached on mechanisms by which MDMA reduces PTSD or enhances therapeutic outcomes, but possible underlying mechanisms for emotional-memory reconsolidation or fear extinction of traumatic memories are surmised based on known functions of brain regions and maladaptive adaptions observed in people with chronic PTSD. For example, men with PTSD have decreased coupling between the hippocampus and amygdala (1), and MDMA administration in healthy controls shows increase connectivity (2). A review article summarizes this point:\r\n\r\n\"The enhanced cross talk between these two regions could be the neural correlate for the reorganization of emotional information contained within memories of the trauma; however, imaging studies of MDMA in a PTSD population have yet to be published and are needed to determine if the same response is observed during recall of traumatic memories. Presumably, the memory trace is updated with new information based on the present perspective of the individual to diminish negative salience that triggers symptoms of PTSD during normal daily life. Participant subjective reports support this idea of a reconstruction of the trauma memory from a juxtaposition of the past memory with a modifiable trace during the MDMA therapy session. For example, a participant from a MAPS-sponsored MDMA-assisted psychotherapy clinical trial described this by saying, 'One thing the MDMA facilitates is thinking about traumatic experiences in a neutral, safe manner. I could objectively think about them and talk about them.' Then, it seems those memories are put back in their place in the brain in a different configuration -- a configuration that does not cause as many problems, such as bad dreams, intrusive thoughts all the time or having horrible insomnia. This has continued to this day, a year and a half after the last MDMA session.\" (3)\r\n\r\nStudies in rodents show MDMA facilitates fear extinction (7, 8) and memory reconsolidation (9).

The recent publication in *Nature* (3) found that MDMA makes social activity more rewarding to mice, similar to how mice respond when they are younger.
