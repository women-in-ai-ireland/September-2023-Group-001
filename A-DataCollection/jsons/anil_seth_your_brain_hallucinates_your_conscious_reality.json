Back in the 17th century, Rene Descartes's philosophy of dualism formalized the idea of that the universe consisted of two substances: \"matter stuff\" (res extensa) and \"mind stuff\" (res cogitans). More recently, the Australian philosopher David Chalmers distinguished the so-called [\"easy\" and \"hard\" problems in neuroscience](http://consc.net/papers/facing.html). The \"easy problem\" is the (really rather difficult) problem of figuring out everything about how brains work and how (with the body) they give rise to perception and behavior. The \"hard problem\" is to figure out how and why any of this has anything to do with consciousness. My own take on this perplexing issue is that it's better to focus on what I call the \"real problem\" of consciousness: put simply, accepting that consciousness exists and trying to explain its properties in terms of processes happening inside brains and bodies. Beyond this TED Talk, I explain this approach in this article called \"the real problem of consciousness\" in [aeon.co](https://aeon.co/essays/the-hard-problem-of-consciousness-is-a-distraction-from-the-real-one); the idea of the \"real problem\" bears similarities to what Chalmers has called the \"mapping problem\" and what Francisco Varela called \"neurophenomenology.\"", "date": null, "linkUrl": null, "source": null, "text": null, "timecode": "03:37", "title": null, "category": "note"}, {"__typename": "Footnote", "author": null, "annotation": "> There are experiences of the world around us, full of sights, sounds and smells, there's multisensory, panoramic, 3D, fully immersive inner movie.\r\n\r\nActually, the phrase \"inner movie\" can be a little misleading, since it might imply something like a movie screen inside the head with a little person inside watching it -- the so-called [\"homuncular fallacy\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homunculus_argument).

In somatoparaphrenia, for example, people report the experience that one of their limbs (e.g. their arm) actually belongs to someone else -- maybe their doctor, or their brother. This and many other disorders of self are elegantly surveyed in Anil Ananthaswamy's [*The Man Who Wasn\u2019t There*](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23398718-the-man-who-wasn-t-there).", "date": null, "linkUrl": null, "source": null, "text": null, "timecode": "11:24", "title": null, "category": "note"}, {"__typename": "Footnote", "author": null, "annotation": "> But it's critically important because perception and regulation of the internal state of the body -- well, that's what keeps us alive.\r\n\r\n\"Interoception\" refers to signals originating from internal bodily organs, transmitted to central nervous system, that reflect the normal functional integrity of those organs, and potentially the functioning of the body as a whole. This definition -- and indeed much of what I know about interoception -- comes from my co-director at the Sackler Centre for Consciousness Science, Prof. Hugo Critchley.", "date": null, "linkUrl": null, "source": null, "text": null, "timecode": "12:01", "title": null, "category": "note"}, {"__typename": "Footnote", "author": null, "annotation": "> We experience the world and ourselves with, through and because of our living bodies.\r\n\r\nIdeas about predictive control also have a long history, in engineering and \"cybernetics\" as well as in psychology and neuroscience. In particular, the 20th-century cybernetic theorist W. Ross Ashby (in collaboration with Roger Conant) developed the influential theorem that \u2018\"every good regulator of a system must be a model of that system.\" Ashby's work on homeostasis provides another connection linking predictive regulation to basic life processes. I connect some of these ideas to modern views about the Bayesian brain in a [book chapter here](http://open-mind.net/papers/the-cybernetic-bayesian-brain).", "date": null, "linkUrl": null, "source": null, "text": null, "timecode": "14:06", "title": null, "category": "note"}, {"__typename": "Footnote", "author": null, "annotation": "> We predict ourselves into existence.\r\n\r\nThere is an interesting historical inversion here. Descartes (him again) argued that one could not attribute mind and consciousness to non-human animals (like dogs) simply because they were made of flesh and blood. For Descartes, at least on some readings, non-human animals were \"beast machines,\" no different in principle (or moral status) from clockwork automata. What I'm suggesting is the opposite -- that we are conscious because of, and not in spite of, the fact that we are beast machines. My forthcoming book [*The Presence Chamber*](http://www.janklowandnesbit.co.uk/anil-seth/presence-chamber) will take this idea -- and the other ideas in this TED Talk -- much farther.", "date": null, "linkUrl": null, "source": null, "text": null, "timecode": "14:55", "title": null, "category": "note"}, {"__typename": "Footnote", "author": null, "annotation": "> Our individual self and worlds are unique to each of us, but they're all grounded in biological mechanisms shared with many other living creatures.\r\n\r\nWhat would be like to be an octopus? These strange animals are the closest thing we have to aliens on earth, which is why I wrote about them as an example of \"alien consciousness\" for Jim Al-Khalili\u2019s book [*Aliens*](https://profilebooks.com/aliens.html). Also well worth reading is philosopher and diver Peter Godfrey-Smith\u2019s meditation on the octopus, [*Other Minds*](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28116739-other-minds).", "date": null, "linkUrl": null, "source": null, "text": null, "timecode": "15:59", "title": null, "category": "note"}, {"__typename": "Footnote", "author": null, "annotation": "> And ... when the end of consciousness comes, there's nothing to be afraid of.
