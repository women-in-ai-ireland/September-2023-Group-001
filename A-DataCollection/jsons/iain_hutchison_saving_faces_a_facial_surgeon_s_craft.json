The &ldquo;Saving Faces&rdquo; exhibit has been seen by more than two million gallery visitors. Hutchison is also an active advocate of running clinical trials for facial surgery, and he funds and co-supervises two psychology PhD students to study ways to improve emotional and functional outcomes.</p><p>As he says: &quot;Facial surgery is challenging not only because of its intricacy but because it has a profound effect on the patient&rsquo;s psyche.&quot;</p>", "slug": "iain_hutchison"}]}, "description": "Maxillofacial surgeon Iain Hutchison works with people whose faces have been severely disfigured.
