And most people today eat food of whose provenance they are unaware. <br /><br />Architect and author Carolyn Steel uses food as a medium to &quot;read&quot; cities and understand how they work. In her book <em><a href=\"http://www.hungrycitybook.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Hungry City</a></em> she traces -- and puts into historical context -- food&#39;s journey from land to urban table and thence to sewer.
