A prolific creator of toys from the get-go (he invented some classic McDonald&#39;s Happy Meal giveaways), <strong>he became a toy-design rockstar in the 1990s with the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furby\" target=\"_blank\">Furby</a> </strong>. Essentially a talking mogwai, the Furby spoke its own language, could communicate with other Furbys, and connected with its owner in a way that sold tens of millions of the dolls. (Versions of the Furby are still in production worldwide -- and are a magnet for <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=circuit+bent+furby&amp;search_type=\" target=\"_blank\">tinkerers</a>.)<br /><br />Retiring to Idaho after this roaring success, Chung started tinkering with another design that uses sophisticated robotics to evoke a deep emotional bond. The <a href=\"http://www.pleoworld.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Pleo</a>  is the result, <strong>a supercute baby dinosaur that begins its emotional and intellectual development when you pull it out of the box</strong>. After a few deadline problems (centered around the challenge of fitting 37 sensors, 14 motors and 7 microcontrollers inside a realistic dinosaur skin), Chung&#39;s company <a href=\"http://www.ugobe.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ugobe</a>&nbsp;(now Pleoworld)&nbsp;shipped Pleo for Christmas 2007.</p>", "slug": "caleb_chung"}]}, "description": "Pleo the robot dinosaur acts like a living pet -- exploring, cuddling, playing, reacting and learning.
