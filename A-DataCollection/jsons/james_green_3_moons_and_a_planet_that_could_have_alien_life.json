Recently, Chojnacki has reported numerous RSL found in the low latitude areas of Melas and Coprates Chasmata (part of Valles Marineris).  However, because of their number and density, and their association with several different topographies, a near sub-surface source of water is difficult to explain.

Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has found that during the season when RSL grow, they contain hydrated perchlorate salts.  Perchlorate salts provide a powerful freezing point depressant, which would keep briny water liquid for a greater portion of the day and for more days in the warm seasons.
