This year, he was named on of the &quot;50 people who cold save the planet&quot;  by the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Guardian</em> </a> newspaper. In 2007 he published&nbsp;<em><a href=\"http://geni.us/coolit\" target=\"_blank\">Cool It: The Skeptical Environmentalist&#39;s Guide to Global Warming</a></em>, further analyzes what today&#39;s science tells us about global warming and its risks. That same year, his next book&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline\" class=\"Apple-style-span\"><em>Solutions for</em></span><em style=\"text-decoration: underline\">&nbsp;the World&#39;s Biggest Problems</em>&nbsp;was released, which provided a summary of the greatest challenges facing humanity.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2004, he convened the <a href=\"http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/Default.aspx?ID=788\" target=\"_blank\">Copenhagen Consensus</a>, which tries to <strong>prioritize the world&#39;s greatest challenges based on the impact we can make, a sort of bang-for-the-buck breakdown</strong> for attacking problems such as global warming, world poverty and disease. <strong><br /><br />It begins from the premise that  we can&#39;t solve every problem in the world, and asks: Which ones should we fix first?</strong> The Copenhagen Consensus 2004 tapped the expertise of world-leading economists, as well as a diverse forum of young participants; collectively, they determined that control of HIV/AIDS was the best investment -- and mitigating global warming was the worst. Lomborg summarized these findings in <em><a href=\"http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521685710http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521685710\" target=\"_blank\">How to Spend $50 Billion to Make the World a Better Place</a>.</em> In spring of 2008, Copenhagen Consensus convened again, assembling over 55 international economists, including 4 Nobel laureates, to assess, prioritize and brainstorm solutions for the major global challenges of today, including conflicts, malnutrition, health, education and terrorism. In 2013, he published&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/seventyfivebillion\" target=\"_blank\"><em>How to Spend $75 Billion to Make the Wolrd a Better Place</em></a>.</p><h1 style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 1.7em; font-weight: normal; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px\" class=\"parseasinTitle \"><br /></h1>", "slug": "bjorn_lomborg"}]}, "description": "Given $50 billion to spend, which would you solve first, AIDS or global warming?
