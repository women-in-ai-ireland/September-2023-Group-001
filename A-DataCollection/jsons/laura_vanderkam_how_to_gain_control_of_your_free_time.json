\r\n\r\nAnalyzing 1,001 days in the lives of women with big jobs and families, I found that most were able to combine work and life just fine. The average work week was long but reasonable, clocking in at 44 hours per week. People slept, on average, 54 hours per week, or just a little under 8 hours per day. Subtract 44 hours and 54 hours from the 168 hours in a week, and you get 70 hours left over. Not surprisingly, women found time in those 70 hours to enjoy meaningful relationships with kids, partners and friends, and they pursue their own interests, too.

While some researchers disagree with this finding, I know from my own time diary studies that people often have a vision of a \"typical\" week that does not involve late starts, family issues, dental visits or anything else that might detract from regular hours. \r\n\r\nI used to think I worked 50 hours per week.
