Sleep, work, and survival activities statistics come from the [Bureau of Labor Statistics Time Use Survey](https://www.bls.gov/tus/charts/). According to this survey (on data from 2015), each day, Americans aged between 25 and 54 with spend an average of 8.8 hours on work and work-related activities; an average of 7.8 hours sleeping; and an average of 3.3 hours on survival activities (eating and drinking, caring for others, and household chores). Though the basic patterns are consistent, the data vary across the population such that older people spend more time sleeping and engaging in leisure pursuits; parents spend more time on survival-related activities (and those with younger children spend less time sleeping!); and unemployed people obviously spend less time working, though many spend a considerable portion of the day actively seeking work.

In *Why We Buy* (Simon & Schuster, 1999), Underhill explained that clothing store shoppers would stop browsing a rack of clothes when they were jostled by one or two people who were trying to squeeze past. Underhill called this effect the \"butt-brush effect.\" When he interviewed the shoppers who stopped browsing after a butt brush, they had no idea they were stopping because they had been jostled; often, they fabricated stories that explained why they had moved on. But the pattern was undeniable -- the sensation of being jostled was a stopping cue, even if its role eluded the shoppers who were encouraged to move on.
