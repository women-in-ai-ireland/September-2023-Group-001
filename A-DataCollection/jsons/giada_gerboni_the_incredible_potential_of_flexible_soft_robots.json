As she says: &quot;One of the most exciting parts of this research is to enable surgical operations in ways that, not long ago, had not yet been conceived.&quot;</p><p>Gerboni received BE and MS degrees in biomedical engineering from the&nbsp;University of Pisa and a PhD in biorobotics from The BioRobotics Institute of Sant&rsquo;Anna School of Advanced Studies in Pisa, Italy. During her PhD, she specialized in surgical robotics, studying and developing innovative strategies for the actuation and sensing of soft and flexible instruments for applications in MIS (Minimally Invasive Surgery).</p><p>A new branch of robotics, called &quot;soft robotics,&quot; is expanding the&nbsp;boundaries of robotic applications. Soft robotics faces the grand challenge of increasing the capabilities of robots to make them more suitable for physical interactions with the real world. It involves use of soft and flexible materials, deformable sensors and very different control strategies than traditional robots, which are designed to work in well-defined and confined environments. Gerboni has been involved in this field from the time of her PhD, and since then she has been exploring its potential in the medical/surgical area, where safe robot-environment interaction is crucial.&nbsp;</p>", "slug": "giada_gerboni"}]}, "description": "Robots are designed for speed and precision -- but their rigidity has often limited how they're used.

These actuators are made up of soft material (an elastomer) incorporating a series of channels and chambers. A pressurized fluid navigating these chambers generates stress from inside the material, causing the material to deform and thus enabling the motion of the actuator. Different chamber geometries or material resistance to the generated strain determine different motion modalities. More info on design, manufacturing and modeling of soft fluidic actuators can be found in the [Soft Robotic Toolkit](https://softroboticstoolkit.com/).\r\nAlternative actuation strategies (that do not use fluid pressure) in soft robotics are: electro-active polymers, shape memory alloys and polymers, smart materials or origami-based structures responsive to magnetic fields and other inputs. Actuators for soft robotics might also include those responsible for changing the stiffness of the structure in such a way that higher payloads can be supported by the robotic structure.
