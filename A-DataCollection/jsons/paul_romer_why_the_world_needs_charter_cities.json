We must also speed up the discovery and implementation of new rules, of new ideas about how people interact. <br /><br />Throughout human history, big improvements in systems of rules took place when new governments entered the scene. In today&#39;s world, this process has been largely shut down. To bring it back to life, Romer proposes that we create new cities where people can go to escape from bad rules and opt in to new and better ones.
