Going deeper, their experiments also search for clues that primates possess a theory of mind -- an ability to think about what other people think. </p><p>Most recently, the lab has been looking at behaviors that were once the province mainly of novelists: jealousy, frustration, judgment of others&#39; intentions, poor economic choices. In one experiment, Santos and her team <strong>taught monkeys to use a form of money</strong>, tradeable for food. When certain foods became cheaper, monkeys would, like humans, overbuy.
