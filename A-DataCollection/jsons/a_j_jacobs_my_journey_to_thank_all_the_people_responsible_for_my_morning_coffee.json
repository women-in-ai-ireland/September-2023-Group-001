For example, Yuezhou Huo, a former research assistant of mine, designed an experiment in which she promised subjects a cash prize in exchange for completing a survey about a positive thing that had recently happened to them. She asked one group of participants to list factors beyond their control that contributed to the event, a second group to list personal qualities and actions that contributed to it, and a control group to simply explain why the good thing had happened. After completing the survey, subjects were given an opportunity to donate some or all of their reward to charity.\r\n\r\n\"Those who had been prompted to credit external causes -- many mentioned luck, as well as factors such as supportive spouses, thoughtful teachers, and financial aid -- donated 25 percent more than those who\u2019d been asked to credit personal qualities or choices.
