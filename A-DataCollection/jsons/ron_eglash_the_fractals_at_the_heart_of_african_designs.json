By looking at aerial-view photos -- and then following up with detailed research on the ground -- Eglash discovered that <strong>many African villages are purposely laid out to form perfect fractals</strong>, with self-similar shapes repeated in the rooms of the house, and the house itself, and the clusters of houses in the village, in mathematically predictable patterns. <br /><br />As he puts it: &quot;When Europeans first came to Africa, they considered the architecture very disorganized and thus primitive. It never occurred to them that the <strong>Africans might have been using a form of mathematics that they hadn&#39;t even discovered yet</strong>.&quot; <br /><br />His other areas of study are equally fascinating, including research into African and Native American cybernetics, teaching kids math through <a href=\"http://www.ccd.rpi.edu/Eglash/csdt/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">culturally specific design tools</a> (such as the <a href=\"http://www.ccd.rpi.edu/Eglash/csdt/subcult/brdance/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Virtual Breakdancer</a>  applet, which explores rotation and sine functions), and <strong>race and ethnicity issues in science and technology</strong>. Eglash teaches in the Department of Science and Technology Studies at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in New York, and he recently co-edited the book <em><a href=\"http://geni.us/appropriatingtech\" target=\"_blank\">Appropriating Technology</a></em>, about how we reinvent consumer tech for our own uses. </p><p>&nbsp;</p>", "slug": "ron_eglash"}]}, "description": "'I am a mathematician, and I would like to stand on your roof.'
