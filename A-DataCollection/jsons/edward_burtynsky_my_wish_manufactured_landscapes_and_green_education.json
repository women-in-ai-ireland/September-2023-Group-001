Burtynsky&#39;s large-format color photographs explore the impact of humanity&#39;s expanding footprint and the substantial ways in which we&#39;re reshaping the surface of the planet. His images powerfully alter the way we think about the world and our place in it. </p><p>With his blessing and encouragement, <a href=\"http://www.worldchanging.com/archives//006356.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"WorldChanging.com\">WorldChanging.com</a>  and others use his work to inspire ongoing global conversations about sustainable living. Burtynsky&#39;s photographs are included in the collections of over 50 museums around the world, including the Tate, London and the Museum of Modern Art and the Guggenheim in New York City. A large-format book, 2003&#39;s <a href=\"http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=0300099436\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Manufactured Landscapes,</em></a> collected his work, and in 2007, a documentary based on his photography, also called <em><a href=\"http://geni.us/manulandscapesdoc\" target=\"_blank\">Manufactured Landscapes</a>,</em> debuted at the Toronto Film Festival before going on to screen at Sundance and elsewhere. It was released on DVD in March 2007. In 2008, after giving a talk at the&nbsp;Long Now Foundation, Burtynsky proposed &quot;The 10,000 Year Gallery,&quot; which could house art to be curated over thousands of years preserved through carbon transfers in an effort to reflect the attitudes and changes of the world over time.&nbsp;</p><p>When Burtynsky accepted his 2005 <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/pages/view/id/6\" target=\"_blank\">TED Prize</a>, he made three <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/pages/view/id/109\" target=\"_blank\">wishes</a>. One of his wishes: to build a website that will help kids think about going green. Thanks to WGBH and the TED community, the show and site <em><a href=\"http://www.meetthegreens.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Meet the Greens</a></em> debuted at TED2007. His second wish: to begin work on an Imax film, which morphed into the jaw-dropping film <em>Manufactured Landscapes</em> with Jennifer Baichwal. And his third wish, wider in scope, was simply to encourage &quot;a massive and productive worldwide conversation about sustainable living.&quot; Thanks to his help and the input of the TED community, the site <a href=\"http://www.worldchanging.com/archives//006356.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"WorldChanging.com\">WorldChanging.com</a> got an infusion of energy that has helped it to grow into a leading voice in the sustainability community.</p><p>In 2016, he won a Governor General&#39;s Award in Visual and Media Arts for his work.</p>", "slug": "edward_burtynsky"}]}, "description":
