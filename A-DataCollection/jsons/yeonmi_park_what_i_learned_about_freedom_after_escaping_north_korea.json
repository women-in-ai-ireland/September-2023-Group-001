She was 16 years old, and I was 13 years old. I need you to understand what the word \"escape\" means in the context of North Korea. We were all starving, and hunger means death in North Korea. So it was the only option for us. I didn't even understand the concept of escape, but I could see the lights from China at night, and I wondered if I go where the light is, I might be able to find a bowl of rice.\"\r\n\r\nWhile there have been informational [discrepancies](https://thediplomat.com/2014/12/the-strange-tale-of-yeonmi-park/) between interviews I gave when I first spoke to the media, I have since tried to address these in my memoir, *In Order to Live*. Sadly, I cannot go back and individually address articles written in 2014 and my hope was that the book would suffice. My family was well-off (relative to other North Koreans) when my father made his living as a smuggler of metals. After my father was sent to a prison labor camp, we were thrown into terrible poverty. After my father's release from the prison camp, he was too sick to work, and our family was on the verge of starvation. It was during that period that my sister and I decided to escape into China to look for food and possibly for work. Due to my hospitalization, my sister escaped first into China. My mother and I followed her a few days later, leaving my father behind. We were tricked and immediately trafficked in China, destined to be sold as \"brides.\" After being bought and sold twice, I was sold to a third broker who helped reunite my family by buying back my mother and paying for my father to be smuggled into China. After eventually escaping to South Korea, I hid the fact that we were trafficked and what we had to do in order to survive. I was only 15 years old by that time, and I wanted to get married someday and have a family. My past was too shameful to admit, even after I became a television personality, and later an activist to free my people. In order to escape the prejudices of many South Koreans, I created a new identity for myself. I changed the story of our life in North Korea, our horrific poverty and I left out the horrible facts of our captivity and the sexual exploitation that occurred. My mother and I let people think we had been \"rich\" in order to block out the humiliation of starvation. Once I was able to tell the whole story in my memoir, I no longer had to live with shameful secrets. [This article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/15/park-yeon-mi-north-korea-defector) further explains these discrepancies and was written by Maryanne Vollers, who helped verify my story when we collaborated on my memoir.", "date": null, "linkUrl": null, "source": null, "text": null, "timecode": "00:49", "title": null, "category": "note"}, {"__typename": "Footnote", "author": null, "annotation": "> \"For example, the word 'love' has only one meaning: love for the Dear Leader.

In this talk, I specifically am referring to the concept of \"love\" as expressed between two ordinary people. In my time in North Korea, the words for such a strong emotional bond were reserved only to describe our feelings for the Dear Leader, Kim Jong-Il, or his father, Kim Il-Sung, or the State. There was no word or phrase for romantic love in my vocabulary. I never said \"I love you\" to my parents, or to my first school crush. Neither did my friends. North Koreans generally do not freely speak of such things, so I am generalizing from my own experience and observations.

North Korean propaganda depicts the Kim leaders as sacrificing themselves and working tirelessly. North Koreans are taught to think of the Kim leaders as gods, and to ascribe supernatural powers to them.

Power usually goes off at night, which makes it one of the darkest places to live on earth -- both physically and metaphorically.
