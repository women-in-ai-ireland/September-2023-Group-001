Her research has tackled questions ranging from &quot;How were the most ancient objects in the universe formed?&quot; to &quot;What can the smallest galaxies tell us about the evolution of the universe?&quot; She has also broken new ground teaching, developing nontraditional courses such as &quot;Unsolved Mysteries in the Universe&quot; and &quot;Math and Beauty in the Cosmos.&quot; Johnson is a professor at the University of Virginia and the president of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific.</p><p>In 2016, Johnson was appointed by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy to the Astronomy and Astrophysics Advisory Committee, and in 2017 she was elected to the board of the American Astronomical Society.
