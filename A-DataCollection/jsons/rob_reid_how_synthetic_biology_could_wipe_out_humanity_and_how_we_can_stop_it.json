As a result, those ten attacks combined killed fewer victims than that one grotesque assault in Newtown, Connecticut -- which, by macabre coincidence, occurred just a few hours after the last of the Chinese attacks. As I've noted elsewhere, the worst suicidal mass murderers are not limited by their consciences or their awful ambitions. They're mostly constrained by the tools they can access. That's knives in China, assault weapons in the US and, in rare but horrifying circumstances, a commercial jet under the command of a suicidal pilot who forces everyone on board to join him in his contemptibly selfish suicide.

I used it since this talk is not about nuclear proliferation -- a subject which could easily fill an entire conference of TED Talks! In reality, Western powers other than the US (France, Great Britain and Israel) and China also had nuclear capabilities during the Cold War, which they retain. So did South Africa, for a period of about a decade. While any of these countries could have unilaterally used their weapons at any time, for practical purposes the nuclear rivalry was viewed as a bi-polar standoff, with its main protagonists in Moscow and Washington. In the wake of the USSR's collapse and South Africa's denuclearization, the list of nuclear-armed nations rose to nine, as Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan all inherited arsenals. All but Russia subsequently denuclearized, but India, Pakistan and North Korea later developed nuclear arms -- so the total number of nuclear states is [again nine](https://www.sipri.org/sites/default/files/2017-06/fs_1707_wnf.pdf).
