As the director of nutrition services for the Berkeley (California) Unified School District, <strong>she&#39;s an outspoken activist for serving fresh, sustainable food to kids</strong>. Her lively website, <a href=\"http://www.chefann.com/\">ChefAnn.com</a>, rounds up recipes, links, and resources for food activism. </p><p>Cooper&#39;s influential program in Berkeley <strong>involves kids in every stage of the food they eat</strong>, from growing to disposing of it. And along the way, eating some delicious cafeteria lunches. She&#39;s also recently become one of the most enterprising members of Jamie Oliver&#39;s Food Revolution, launching <a href=\"http://www.thelunchbox.org/\">TheLunchBox.org</a> to give schools the resources and support they need to transform their menus and provide balanced, healthy meals. In line with that effort, she is partnering with Whole Foods on the <a href=\"http://www.saladbarproject.org/\">Great American Salad Project (GASP)</a>, which will create fresh salad bars in over 300 schools around the U.S.&nbsp; </p><p>She&#39;s the author of <a href=\"http://www.lunchlessons.org/html_v2/books.html\" target=\"_blank\">several books</a>, including <a
