The study pointed out a number of advantages to using chemoautotrophic knallgas microorganisms for CO2 capture and conversion over more familiar photoautotrophic organisms, such as plants and algae; or than phyicochemical methods.  These advantages included: 1) far higher energy efficiency in the CO2 conversion, resulting in ten times lower electrical power requirements for a system using knallgas microorganisms, than an equivalent system using algae; and thirty times lower power requirements than a system based on higher plants; 2) connected to advantage 1) \u2013 the generation of waste heat that would need to be removed from the system was at least ten times higher for algae and plants than for knallgas microorganisms; 3) considerably lower weight and volume requirements for a CO2 system using knallgas microbes than one using algae or plants due to greater compactness of a knallgas microbe based system.", "eyebrow": null, "headline": "Study of life support systems for space missions exceeding one year in duration", "isPdf": false, "label": "READ_ARTICLE", "linkUrl": "http://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19670025255", "note": "G.L.
