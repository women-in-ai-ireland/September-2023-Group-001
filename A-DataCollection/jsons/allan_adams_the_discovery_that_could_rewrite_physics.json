His research in theoretical physics focuses on string  theory both as a model of quantum gravity and as a strong-coupling  description of non-gravitational systems. </p><p>Like water, string theory enjoys many distinct phases in which the  low-energy phenomena take qualitatively different forms. In its most  familiar phases, string theory reduces to a perturbative theory of  quantum gravity. These phases are useful for studying, for example, the  resolution of singularities in classical gravity, or the set of  possibilities for the geometry and fields of spacetime. Along these  lines, Adams is particularly interested in microscopic quantization of  flux vacua, and in the search for constraints on low-energy physics  derived from consistency of the stringy UV completion.</p>In other phases, when the gravitational interactions become strong  and a smooth spacetime geometry ceases to be a good approximation, a  more convenient description of string theory may be given in terms of a  weakly-coupled non-gravitational quantum field theory. Remarkably, these  two descriptions&mdash;with and without gravity&mdash;appear to be completely  equivalent, with one remaining weakly-coupled when its dual is strongly  interacting. This equivalence, known as gauge-gravity duality, allows us  to study strongly-coupled string and quantum field theories by studying  perturbative features of their weakly-coupled duals. Gauge-gravity  duals have already led to interesting predictions for the quark-gluon  plasma studied at RHIC. A major focus of Adams&#39;s present research is to  use such dualities to find weakly-coupled descriptions of  strongly-interacting condensed matter systems which can be realized in  the lab.", "slug": "allan_adams"}]}, "description": "On March 17, 2014, a group of physicists announced a thrilling discovery: the \u201csmoking gun\u201d data for the idea of an inflationary universe, a clue to the Big Bang.

As explained more patiently and thoroughly in the links above, the discovery of primordial gravitational waves via \"twists\" in the CMB is a smoking gun for the idea of [cosmic inflation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_(cosmology)), which posits that the universe went through an epoch of rapid expansion that terminated in the Big Bang. Inflation solved a host of conceptual problems with the standard Big Bang model but had one annoying property: The same mechanism that solved various problems also erased most evidence of the inflationary epoch \u2014 with the exception of primordial gravitational waves, which, if produced with sufficient strength during inflation, would leave their signature in twists in the CMB. By early 2014, however, a long list of circumstantial evidence, together with a murky set of theoretical intuitions, led many of us scientists to believe that the production of inflationary gravitational waves was just too weak to be detectable. This left the theory of inflation in a sort of purgatory \u2014 too successful to be entirely wrong, but too elusive to confirm directly.\r\n\r\nThe BICEP2 results, if they hold up, appear to directly confirm the inflationary picture, in particular some of the simplest and most theoretically natural models of inflation. There are many theories of cosmology that do not use inflation to explain what we see in the CMB, and yet, to a good approximation, every model that accounts for the BICEP2 results ends up looking an awful lot like inflation. Future experiments will be the final arbiter, but from where I stand, the BICEP2 results have inflation tattooed all over them.\r\n\r\nI also skipped over this story of inflation to the more dramatic picture that inflation suggests for the large-scale structure of the universe beyond our observable bubble, a picture called the \"multiverse.\" This picture of our observable world as just one little neighborhood in a much larger universe \u2014 as one cosmological bubble in an inflating universe of other bubbles \u2014 is not conclusively indicated by the BICEP2 discovery.  Rather, given everything we know about inflation and the way it fits into the physics of quantum mechanics and gravity, the BICEP2 results make this picture very natural. To give you a sense of how seriously people took this picture even before the staggeringly awesome BICEP2 results, check out the last paragraph of a paper called \"[Living in the Multiverse](http://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-th/0511037.pdf)\" by the great theorist Steven Weinberg. \r\n\r\n\"About the multiverse, it is appropriate to keep an open mind, and opinions among scientists differ widely. In the Austin airport on the way to this meeting, I noticed for sale the October issue of a magazine called *Astronomy*, having on the cover the headline \u201cWhy You Live in Multiple Universes.\u201d Inside I found a report of a discussion at a conference at Stanford, at which Martin Rees said that he was sufficiently confident about the multiverse to bet his dog\u2019s life on it, while Andrei Linde said he would bet his own life. As for me, I have just enough confidence about the multiverse to bet the lives of both Andrei Linde and Martin Rees\u2019s dog.\"\r\n\r\nBICEP2 didn't prove the existence of the multiverse \u2014 but I'm pretty sure that Sir Martin Rees' dog is resting a lot easier tonight.", "date": null, "linkUrl": null, "source": null, "text": null, "timecode": "03:49", "title": null, "category": "note"}, {"__typename": "Footnote", "author": null, "annotation": "Randall Munroe loves drawing lots and lots of bubbles.
