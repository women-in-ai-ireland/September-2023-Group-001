While a zero-sum game depends on a winner and loser, all parties in a non-zero-sum game win or lose together, so players will more likely survive if they cooperate. <strong>This points to an optimistic future of ultimate cooperation among humans -- if we recognize the game.</strong> <br /><br />Well-respected for his erudition and original thinking (Bill Clinton hailed him as a genius), Wright draws from multiple disciplines -- including science, religion, history and politics -- in his search for <strong>big-picture perspectives on today&#39;s problems</strong>, particularly terrorism, while offering guarded hope for where we might be headed.
