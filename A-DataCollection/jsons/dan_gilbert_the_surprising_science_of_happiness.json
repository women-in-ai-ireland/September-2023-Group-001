In the same way that optical illusions fool our eyes -- and fool everyone&#39;s eyes in the same way -- Gilbert argues that <strong>our brains systematically misjudge what will make us happy</strong>. And these quirks in our cognition make humans very poor predictors of our own bliss.<br /><br />The premise of his current research -- that our assumptions about what will make us happy are often wrong -- is supported with clinical research drawn from psychology and neuroscience. But his delivery is what sets him apart. His engaging -- and often hilarious -- style pokes fun at typical human behavior and invokes pop-culture references everyone can relate to. This winning style translates also to Gilbert&#39;s writing, which is <strong>lucid, approachable and laugh-out-loud funny</strong>. The immensely readable <em><a href=\"http://www.randomhouse.com/kvpa/gilbert/\" target=\"_blank\">Stumbling on Happiness</a>,</em> published in 2006, became a <em>New York Times</em> bestseller and has been translated into 20 languages.<br /><br />In fact, the title of his book could be drawn from his own life. At 19, he was a high school dropout with dreams of writing science fiction. When a creative writing class at his community college was full, he enrolled in the only available course: psychology. He found his passion there, earned a doctorate in social psychology in 1985 at Princeton, and has since won a Guggenheim Fellowship and the Phi Beta Kappa teaching prize for his work at Harvard. He has written essays and articles for <em>The New York Times, Time</em> and even <a href=\"http://wjh-www.harvard.edu/~dtg/STARBUCKS%20CUP.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Starbucks</a>, while <strong>continuing his research into happiness at his <a href=\"http://wjh-www.harvard.edu/~dtg/gilbert.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Hedonic Psychology Laboratory</a>.</strong></p>", "slug": "dan_gilbert"}]}, "description": "Dan Gilbert, author of \"Stumbling on Happiness,\" challenges the idea that we'll be miserable if we don't get what we want.

winners and paraplegics**\r\n\r\nThe first mistake occurred when I misstated the facts about the 1978 study by Brickman, Coates and Janoff-Bulman on lottery winners and paraplegics.\r\n\r\nI said, \u201c\u2026a year after losing the use of their legs, and a year after winning the lotto, lottery winners and paraplegics are equally happy with their lives.\u201d In fact, the two groups were not equally happy: Although the lottery winners (M=4.00) were no happier than controls (M=3.82), both lottery winners and controls were slightly happier than paraplegics (M=2.96).\r\n\r\nSo why has this study become the poster child for the concept of hedonic adaptation? First, most of us would expect lottery winners to be much happier than controls, and they weren\u2019t. Second, most of us would expect paraplegics to be wildly less happy than either controls or lottery winners, and in fact they were only slightly less happy (though it is admittedly difficult to interpret numerical differences on rating scales like the ones used in this study). As the authors of the paper noted, \u201cIn general, lottery winners rated winning the lottery as a highly positive event, and paraplegics rated their accident as a highly negative event, though neither outcome was rated as extremely as might have been expected.\u201d Almost 40 years later, I suspect that most psychologists would agree that this study produced rather weak and inconclusive findings, but that the point it made about the unanticipated power of hedonic adaptation has now been confirmed by many more powerful and methodologically superior studies.

Bad notes? Bad sources? Demonic possession? Sorry, I just don\u2019t remember. But while I got these ancillary facts wrong, I got the key facts right: Mr. Bickham did spend 37 years in prison, he did utter those words upon his release, and he was (and apparently still is) much happier than most of us would expect ourselves to be in such circumstances.
