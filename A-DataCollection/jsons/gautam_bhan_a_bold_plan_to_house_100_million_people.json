It&#39;s in these cities that many of the battles of sustainability and equity will either be won or lost. He found his way to these questions in his own city -- New Delhi -- through forced evictions, the brutal demolition of the homes of the city&#39;s poorest who lived in informal settlements that brought him to his work on housing and the right to the city.
