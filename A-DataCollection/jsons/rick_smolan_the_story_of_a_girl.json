More than 20,000 photographers -- pros and amateurs -- sent images to a team of editors assembled by Smolan and partner Jennifer Erwitt, who turned the photos into an eye-popping book. It&#39;s become a best-seller, of course, helped along by the fact that <a href=\"http://www.myamericaathome.com/customcover/\" target=\"_blank\">buyers can choose their own image for the cover</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Smolan has long been a force for <strong>exploring culture through photography</strong>. The Day in the Life photography series that he cofounded -- best-selling photo books that captured life in America, Australia,  the Soviet Union ... -- were an &#39;80s cultural phenomenon. (Rare was the coffee table without at least one of them.) In the 1990s his production company, <a href=\"http://www.againstallodds.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Against All Odds</a>, investigated the storytelling powers of interactive CD-ROMs with <em>From Alice to Ocean</em>, a narrative of a cross-Australia trek, and <em>Passage to Vietnam</em>, exploring that country as it opened up in the early 1990s. <em>24 Hours in Cyberspace</em> took a snapshot of the booming industry in 1996, and <em>One Digital Day</em> in 1997 further explored our fascination with tech.</p><p>Along with collaborator Jennifer Erwitt, Smolan published the beautiful <em><a href=\"http://marketplace.publicradio.org/display/web/2007/12/17/blueplanet_smolan_q/\" target=\"_blank\">Blue Planet Run</a>&nbsp;</em>in 2007, about the drive to bring fresh drinking water to everyone on Earth.
