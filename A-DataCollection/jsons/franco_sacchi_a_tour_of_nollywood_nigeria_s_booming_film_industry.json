Of course, we filmed and edited the Nollywood story with our own sensibilities, but our greatest hope is that the authentic voices of the Nigerian filmmakers will be heard.<br /><br />Nollywood filmmakers are conscious of the responsibility they have toward their society -- director Bond Emeruwa says they feel an obligation to &quot;put a message in there.&quot; But the production of each movie is also an adventure -- overcoming hurdles unimaginable in the West, racing against an impossibly short clock.<br />&nbsp;</p>", "slug": "franco_sacchi"}]}, "description": "Zambia-born filmmaker Franco Sacchi tours us through Nollywood, Nigeria's booming film industry (the world's 3rd largest).
