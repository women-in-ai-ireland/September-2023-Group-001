That environment now boasts milions of citizens and a buzzing economy (currency: Linden dollars) that represents over $10 million in real value.</p><p>Second Life may be artificial but it&#39;s hardly trivial, Rosedale says. Its appeal to human creativity is obvious, but beyond the<strong> thriving in-world industries and bustling social spaces</strong>, real-life businesses (and even some religious organizations) are using Second Life as a platform for meetings, services and collaboration. </p><p>&quot;You can imagine New York City being kind of like a museum,&quot; Rosedale says. &quot;Still an incredibly cool place to go, but with no one working in those towers.
