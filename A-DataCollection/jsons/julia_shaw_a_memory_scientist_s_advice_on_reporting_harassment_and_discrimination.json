Too often, harassment and discrimination is a lonely and isolating experience, but we need to help people out from under their desks. We need to empower people to have a voice.\"\r\n\r\nThe 98 percent figure is based on our research at Spot, looking across research on this issue. It highlights the very high levels of non-reporting that have been recorded by some sources. For example, our calculated figures of LGBT worker experiences show that 0.17% of harassment is reported and 99.83% goes unreported. This means that we can say that for some groups of people, it seems that at least 98% of harassment goes unreported. However, other estimates place the under-reporting figures lower than this. \r\n\r\nThat being said, estimated rates of non-reporting (individuals who are harassed or discriminated against at work but never report it) vary widely. Things that influence whether someone - for example a survey participant - says they have ever been harassed include how the question is phrased and whether the participants know all the different behaviors and experiences that can count as harassment. Many people are not familiar with the legal definitions of harassment and discrimination, and this can contribute to underestimating the experience of it. The elusive, sensitive, and complex nature of experiences of harassment and discrimination make it virtually impossible to have a single percentage that captures a precise snapshot of how big of a problem underreporting is. Still, one consistency emerges across the research - it consistently evidences that the majority of those who experience workplace harassment or discrimination never report it to their employers.\r\n\r\nFor more figures and references about reporting rates and a summary of our preliminary literature review see [this article](http://theconversation.com/in-the-metoo-era-a-chatbot-can-help-people-report-workplace-harassment-92565)\r\n\r\nFurther information on barriers to reporting can be found in our written evidence for the \"[House of Commons Select Committee Inquiry on Sexual Harassment in the Workplace](https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/women-and-equalities-committee/inquiries/parliament-2017/sexual-harassment-workplace-17-19/publications/)\" published in 2018 on the UK parliamentary website.", "date": null, "linkUrl": null, "source": null, "text": null, "timecode": "01:37", "title": null, "category": "note"}, {"__typename": "Footnote", "author": null, "annotation": "> \"I'm a memory scientist, and I specialize in how we remember important emotional events.\"\r\n\r\nYou can access my brief biography, CV and my academic publications [on my website](https://www.drjuliashaw.com/research/).\r\n\r\nI have also published a bestselling book about the fallibility of memory -- [*The Memory Illusion*](https://www.amazon.com/Memory-Illusion-Remembering-Forgetting-Science/dp/1847947611/) -- which has been translated into 18 languages.", "date": null, "linkUrl": null, "source": null, "text": null, "timecode": "02:37", "title": null, "category": "note"}, {"__typename": "Footnote", "author": null, "annotation": "> \"After looking at lab reports and working, studying this issue both in the courtroom and in research settings, I've dissected all the different things that can go wrong with our memories that can really threaten your case.

The CI mostly consists of a set of standard questions that the interviewer is expected to ask verbatim. The interviewer is trained to not interrupt and to let the interviewee speak freely. The CI has been found to elicit up to 40% more information from eyewitnesses in comparison to a standard police interview, without decreasing accuracy (Memon, Meissner, & Fraser, 2010).\r\n\r\nThe interviewer is also trained to ask meaningful follow-up questions called \u201cprobes\u201d, using only information already provided by the interviewee to ask for more details. For example, the interviewee may have mentioned \u201cTuesday\u201d and the interviewer would say \u201cYou mentioned Tuesday, can you tell me more about that?\u201d. The CI was originally designed as an information-seeking, non-accusatorial, non-leading way of getting high-quality memory details in the context of police investigations. \r\n\r\nMore information on why our chatbot can effectively be used to administer the CI [here](https://behavioralscientist.org/the-system-for-reporting-sexual-harassment-is-broken-heres-how-to-fix-it/)\r\n\r\nFisher, R.
