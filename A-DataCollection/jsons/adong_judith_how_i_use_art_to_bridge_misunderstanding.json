Only Ugandans were eligible for the first two editions of the apprenticeship (2016 and 2017). The 2018 edition and future editions have been opened for to aspiring director across the African continent. \r\n\r\nAdong has always been disturbed by the practicum gap in Uganda\u2019s performing arts education due to limited and limiting training institutions, which was a big part of her struggle in the pursuit of her dream to be a theatre/filmmaker. Due to many eligibility inquiry emails from across the African\u2019s continent, Adong recognizes that this practicum gap in performing arts training cuts across Africa, hence opening it up to the continent. The training is aimed to equip Africans with hands-on craft as well as mentor them in telling stories that dare to ask serious questions.

What they need is someone to mentor them in the craft that would structure their talents in ways that would make humanity put value to them and give them the attention they deserve\u201d, asserts Adong.\r\napply now for our [Theatre Directors\u2019 Apprenticeship](https://www.silentvoicesuganda.org/theatre-creative-directors-africa), the call is open until 1st May 2018, for aspiring (inexperienced) and or experienced creative directors living on the continent.", "eyebrow": "", "headline": "Theatre Directors\u2019 Apprenticeship Program", "isPdf": false, "label": "EXPLORE", "linkUrl": "", "note": ""}, {"__typename": "RecommendationItem", "blurb": "*Silent Voices* is a poignant war crimes story that mirrors views and emotions of actual victims of the Northern Uganda war.

The play received emotive reviews, successfully setting precedent for the rebirth of theatre since Amin\u2019s terror 70s\r\n\r\nThe play, which questions the underlying issues neglected by the Amnesty Act, was inspired by Adong\u2019s personal interviews with the children under rehabilitation at World Vision Center, where she was studying the use of theatre in the psycho-social support of former child soldiers of the LRA rebel group. While the religious rehabilitation taught forgiveness, without which \"they would go to hell,\" most of the children confessed that without religion, \"there was no way in hell they would forgive.\"  Community dialogues also revealed that their parents were dissatisfied with the way rebels were being \"rewarded\" with what was dubbed resettlement package (money, cars, housing etc) under the Amnesty Act, while victims still had wounds to nurse. [Watch extracts of *Silent Voices*\u2019s World Premiere at the Uganda National Theatre [here](https://vimeo.com/90416298).

Under his regime, several artists were allegedly assassinated, including Baron Kawadwa (who nationally initiated music, dance and drama competitions in schools and was murdered after staging a performance of \"Oluyimba lwa Wankoko\u201d (Song of the Hen) which critiqued Amin\u2019s dictatorial government).

It explores how victims have been ignored in the constant calls to \"forgive\" and \"reconcile\" at the expense of justice. Through the protagonist, Mother -- a symbolic representation of life and death -- Silent Voices examines what good citizens can be driven into by unhealthy policies. It received its world premiere at the National Theatre of Uganda in 2012 and had 12 full house shows with talk back sessions after every show bringing key stakeholders to the conversation table.\r\n\r\nThe **Northern Uganda War**, 1986-2006, was a war that started with current President of Uganda, Yoweri Museveni Kaguta, rising to power in 1986, and it lasted until 2006. The Acholi leaders were protesting the new government\u2019s inhumane treatment of its people who had dominated Ugandan politics before. It saw many changes in rebel leadership including renown woman commander, Alice Auma Lakwena, with Joseph Kony as the last of this chain of leaders.\r\n\r\n**The government** refers to the National Resistance Movement under the leadership of President Yoweri Museveni Kaguta, who has ruled Uganda for the last 32 years. \r\n\r\n**LRA** refers to the Lord\u2019s Resistance Army, the last of the Northern Uganda war rebel group known to have recruited one of the largest child soldiers in history, under the leadership of Joseph Kony, the self-acclaimed messenger of God for the liberation of the Acholi people of Northern Uganda.\r\n\r\n**Amnesty Commission** is the body behind the internationally adapted government approach (Amnesty Act) to end the Northern Uganda war with promises of forgiveness to rebel groups who surrender in a bid to bring about peace. The approach offered gifts to rebels dubbed resettlement package, which included among others housing, cars and money, which the victims viewed as rewarding perpetrators for atrocities they committed; while they, the victims, were being ignored or worse coerced to forgive the perpetrators.\r\n\r\n**Transitional Justice** is part of the Amnesty Act that advocated for the adaption of traditional African justice systems to motivate the rebels to surrender as well as bring reconciliation between perpetrators and victims in a bid to end the Northern Uganda war and bring about peace. The only problem, the people of Northern Uganda argued, was that the government only conveniently selected elements of the system that worked for it, leaving out expectations and responsibility of reparation and retribution which are key requirements of the Acholi traditional justice system. It took on only the symbolic ritual of the drinking of the bitter herb, Oput, from the leaves of the Oput tree. Hence, the popular Mato Oput (Acholi Traditional Justice System).
