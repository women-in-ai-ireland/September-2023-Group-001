Always, he&#39;d been a kind of polite engineer-gadfly -- refusing to settle for subpar code or muddled thinking. </p><p>In 2000, with a landmark cover story in <em>Wired</em> called &quot;Why the Future Doesn&#39;t Need Us,&quot; Joy began to share his larger concerns with the world. A careful observer of the nanotech industry that was growing up around his own industry, Joy saw a way forward that, frankly, frightened him. He saw a very plausible future in which our own creations supplanted us -- if not out and out killed us (e.g., the gray goo problem). His proposed solution: Proceed with caution.</p><p>Joy&#39;s now a partner at KPMG, where he reviews business plans in education, environmental improvement and pandemic defense. </p>", "slug":
