What is the function of emotions such as disgust, gratitude and shame? And what can psychology tell us about the most pressing moral and political issues of our time, including belief in conspiracy theories, the role of genes in explaining human differences and the debate around implicit racial bias? In <a href=\"http://geni.us/howpleasureworks\"><em>How Pleasure Works</em></a>, Bloom explores the often-mysterious enjoyment that people get out of experiences such as sex, food, art and stories. In <a href=\"http://geni.us/justbabies\"><em>Just Babies</em></a> and <a href=\"https://geni.us/SLPLlof\"><em>Against Empathy</em></a>, he examines the nature and origins of our sense of good and evil, and in <a href=\"https://geni.us/5bDR\"><em>The Sweet Spot</em></a>, he looks at the relationship between suffering and the good life. Much of his writing is about research he does with his colleagues and his students.<br><br>Bloom is a passionate teacher, and his popular free course in <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-psychology\">Introduction to Psychology</a> on Coursera has had more than a million students. He also presents his research through articles in <em>The Atlantic, The New Yorker</em> and <em>The New York Times</em>.
