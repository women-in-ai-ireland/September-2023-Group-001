He leads JPL&#39;s efforts to build robots that explore space -- including the surprisingly long-lived Mars Rovers. In the wake of the Rovers&#39; success (and even fame), it&#39;s worth remembering that they grew out of some troubled earlier attempts to reach Mars. Elachi&#39;s careful management of the Rover program, wrote the <a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/061022/30elachi.htm\" target=\"_blank\"><em>US News and World Report</em></a>, was a key piece of its success. And Elachi gives equal credit to some extraordinary luck. </p><p>As JPL&#39;s director for space and Earth science programs from 1982 to 2000, and then its head since then, he&#39;s led the development of many new instruments and programs for observing Earth and exploring the planets. It&#39;s in part thanks to him that, as of May 2008, we have <a href=\"http://blogs.artcenter.edu/designconference/page/2/\" target=\"_blank\">17 different robots</a>  exploring space.
