Thus, she has known from the time she was 14 years old that she wanted to work on missions of robotic space exploration. &nbsp;</p><p>Cox realized her childhood dream and has been a spacecraft operations engineer at NASA/JPL for over 20 years.

She has also received the NASA Exceptional Service Medal and two NASA Exceptional Achievement Medals. She is a U.S. Department of State STEM Speaker and has spoken to audiences around the world on the stories of the people behind the missions. She has also served on Cornell University&rsquo;s President&#39;s Council for Cornell Women.</p><p>Before her time at JPL, Cox served for 6 years in the US Air Force including duty as a Space Operations Officer at NORAD/US Space Command.
