As an expert in biochemistry and biophysics at the University of California at San Francisco, she is particularly interested in the influence that genetics have on age-related diseases (from cancer to heart failure) in living things.<br /><br />Her biggest breakthrough was figuring out that there&rsquo;s a &ldquo;universal hormonal control for aging&rdquo;: carbohydrate intake, which can have a dramatic effect on how two critical genes behave, reducing insulin production and boosting repair and renovation activities. So far, her theory has proved true for worms, mice, rats, and monkeys &mdash; and she suspects it applies to humans, too.<br /><br />By studying aging, Kenyon believes that she and other scientists (many of whom have successfully duplicated her experiments) will be able to pinpoint the molecules responsible for the onset of age-related diseases in people and prevent them. She&rsquo;s co-founded a drug-development company called Elixir Pharmaceuticals to do just that.</p><p>She says: &quot;The link between aging and age-related disease suggests an entirely new way to combat many diseases all at once; namely, by going after their greatest risk factor: aging itself.&quot; </p>", "slug": "cynthia_kenyon"}]}, "description": "What controls aging?
