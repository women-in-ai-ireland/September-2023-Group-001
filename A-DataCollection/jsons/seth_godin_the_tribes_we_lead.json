His efforts caught the attention of Yahoo!, which bought the company in 1998 and kept Godin on as a vice president of permission marketing. Godin has produced several critically acclaimed and attention-grabbing books, including&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/permissionmarketing\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Permission Marketing</em></a><em>,&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://geni.us/allmarketersareliars\" target=\"_blank\"><em>All Marketers Are Liars</em></a><em>,</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/purplecow\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Purple Cow</em></a>&nbsp;(which was distributed in a milk carton).
