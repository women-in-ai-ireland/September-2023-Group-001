Within a decade, women had caught up and then just blew right past the men. Today, there's an 18-percentage point gap in the awarding of college degrees.\"\r\n\r\nClarification: According to data from the National Center of Education Statistics, for the academic year 1972-1973, there was a 16-percentage-point difference by sex for all degrees earned, but a 12-percentage point difference in favor of males in the number earning an Associate's or Bachelor's degree. The gap in college degrees (Associate's or Bachelor's) in 2019-2020 is 17.9 percent, according to NCES.

Sex differences in the trajectory of brain development during adolescence have been better documented in the frontal lobe and other areas beyond just the prefrontal cortex.

It is important to note that there is ongoing research on the complicated processes of brain development in adolescence, and their impact on cognition and behavior, as well as the need for newer methodologies and larger sample sizes.

Most, many, at least of the girls, will have pretty carefully organized, nicely labeled binders, and for many, if not most of the boys, it will resemble a small, controlled explosion. It's not that girls are smarter than boys.
