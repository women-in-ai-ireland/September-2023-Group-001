However, Ministry of Justice research conducted in 2012 outlines the ways this data has been collected and analysed. As noted by that 2012 report, this specific figure of 200,000 refers to the number of children in England and Wales who had a parent in prison at some point in 2009 ([pages 16-18](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/278837/prisoners-childhood-family-backgrounds.pdf)). However, Barnardo\u2019s has been highlighting the hidden impact of imprisonment on children and running a range of support services over the last 20 years across the UK, and they believe that [trends for Northern Ireland and Scotland](https://www.barnardos.org.uk/children_of_prisoners) are likely to be very similar.", "date": null, "linkUrl": null, "source": null, "text": null, "timecode": "02:46", "title": null, "category": "note"}, {"__typename": "Footnote", "author": null, "annotation": "> \"Two hundred thousand.

Assuming a current estimate of 200,000 children affected by a parent in prison, it\u2019s likely that this comparison would still hold true today given 2013 numbers on children of divorced couples (which place this figure at less than 140,000 children).
