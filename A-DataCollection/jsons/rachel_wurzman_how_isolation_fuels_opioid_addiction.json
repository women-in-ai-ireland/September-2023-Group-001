In addition to studying the effects of SeekHealing&#39;s programs in opioid-ravaged lives and communities, Wurzman&#39;s ongoing research in neuroethics also addresses the implications of a biopsychosocial and &quot;systems-oriented&quot; perspective on neuropsychiatric spectrum phenomena (such as addiction) for research, treatment and social policy. Her advice and insights into neurocognition have been utilized to inform policy in past positions as a neuroscience and neuroethics advisor to the Pentagon, an intern in the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy under the Obama administration, and through her involvement with the International Neuroethics Society.

For those looking to delve deeper into the neuroscience of this debate, I recommend this review article: [\"Neurobiologic Advances from the Brain Disease Model of Addiction\"](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra1511480).\r\n\r\nHowever, I used the word \"state\" deliberately here. If we view perception and behavior (including that related to \"free will\") as arising from a spectrum of brain states whose likelihood of occurrence are affected by internal and external conditions (i.e., internal brain circuitry and the external environment), then what really matters are the conditions that skew perception and behavior in a given direction. I believe that the experience of deep, authentic connection (to others and perhaps to anything that transcends the Self) is one that can transform these conditions, at both levels.

While also an opioid blocker, naltrexone is used to prevent cravings for both opioids and alcohol, and cannot treat overdoses.

Unlike Naltrexone (the study drug), Naloxone is also a component of Suboxone, in which it is combined with a weaker opioid agonist and administered to prevent opioid withdrawal symptoms.\r\n\r\nViewers are cautioned against over-generalizing the described experimental effects of Naltrexone in non-addicted individuals and applying it to patients undergoing medically-assisted treatment for Opioid Use Disorder.
