you to a larger but no less controversial group of people impacted by traumatic brain injury, who don't often show up in the headlines. I've come to recognize these inmates and probationers as surprisingly among the most vulnerable members of society.\"\r\n\r\nResearch in the Minnesota Department of Corrections suggests that incarcerated persons with TBI have a greater risk of mental illness, increased usage of crisis intervention services, are more likely to abuse substances and have higher rates of disciplinary incidents while they are incarcerated ([Piccolino and Solberg, 2014](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1078345814530871?rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed&url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&journalCode=jcxa)). And our research here at the University of Denver suggests that 96 percent of justice-involved persons with a TBI have a history of substance abuse, 77 percent of them had a history of mental illness and 74 percent of the persons we studied had both a mental illness and substance use disorder (Gorgens, et al., Manuscript in preparation; [Nagele, Gorgens and Dettmer, 2018](https://eventscribe.com/2018/FICTBI/agenda.asp?h=Full Schedule)).", "date": null, "linkUrl": null, "source": null, "text": null, "timecode": "01:02", "title": null, "category": "note"}, {"__typename": "Footnote", "author": null, "annotation": "> \"I'll start with a shocking statistic: 50 to 80 percent of people in criminal justice have a traumatic brain injury. Up to 80 percent.\"\r\n\r\nClarification: Previous research describes self-reported TBI history base rates ranging from 65 to 87 percent across various correctional settings ([Ferguson, et al., 2012](https://journals.lww.com/headtraumarehab/Fulltext/2012/05000/Prevalence_of_Traumatic_Brain_Injury_Among.12.aspx); [Slaughter, Fann and Ehde, 2003; Williams et al., 2010](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0269905031000088649)). One pilot study of 80 inmates from a Denver Detention Center reported that a staggering [96 percent](https://www.newsweek.com/2016/07/08/prison-inmate-traumatic-brain-injury-research-475615.html) had suffered moderate or severe brain trauma. And our research here at the University of Denver found that the rate of reported history of significant TBI among 4407 inmates and probationers ranged from 26.6 to 97 percent depending on the setting ([Glover, et al., 2018](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0093854818765043?journalCode=cjbb); Gorgens, et al., Manuscript in preparation).", "date": null, "linkUrl": null, "source": null, "text": null, "timecode": "01:35", "title": null, "category": "note"}, {"__typename": "Footnote", "author": null, "annotation": "> \"In the general public, in this room, for example, that number is less than five percent.\"\r\n\r\nClarification: There are varied estimates of the prevalence of TBI history in the general population since the injury can range from mild to severe and many people never seek care. A 1999 report from The Center for Disease Control\u2019s National Center for Injury Prevention and Control estimated that [two percent of the population](https://www.cdc.gov/traumaticbraininjury/pubs/tbi_report_to_congress.html) was living with disability as a result of a traumatic brain injury. However, it should be noted that a more recent [CDC report from 2015](https://www.cdc.gov/traumaticbraininjury/pdf/TBI_Report_to_Congress_Epi_and_Rehab-a.pdf), indicates that the availability of data related to the incidence of TBI-related disability is limited and that the few national-level estimates that have been reported are based on extrapolations of state-level data from South Carolina and Colorado.", "date": null, "linkUrl": null, "source": null, "text": null, "timecode": "01:49", "title": null, "category": "note"}, {"__typename": "Footnote", "author": null, "annotation": "> \"Almost every single woman in the criminal justice system has been exposed to interpersonal violence and abuse. More than half of these women have been exposed to repeated brain injuries.\"\r\n\r\nResearch on the prevalence and impact of TBI on justice-involved women is limited, but an area of significant concern. In correctional settings, research suggests that [up to 90 percent](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1557085112439224) of incarcerated women have experienced intimate partner violence. In our research on gender differences in the prevalence and incidence of violence-related traumatic brain injury in criminal justice, we found that 71% of women reported multiple TBIs; specifically, they were twice as likely as men to report multiple TBIs and six times more likely to have multiple violence-related TBIs ([Wall, et al., 2018](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0093854818778082?journalCode=cjbb)).", "date": null, "linkUrl": null, "source": null, "text": null, "timecode": "02:16", "title": null, "category": "note"}, {"__typename": "Footnote", "author": null, "annotation": "> \"They get into fights.

Statistically speaking, they're actually more likely to be rearrested than not.\"\r\n\r\nResearch suggests that persons with TBI are more likely to recidivate; specifically, persons with TBI tend to experience an arrest sooner than those without TBI. In one study, half of the inmates with TBI were rearrested and, notably, they were rearrested sooner after release than those without a TBI history ([Ray and Richardson, 2017](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0093854816686631)). Additionally, adults with TBI were younger at the time of entry into the criminal justice system compared to adults without TBI, and were more frequently in custody than persons without TBI  ([Williams, et al., 2010](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/02699052.2010.495697?journalCode=ibij20)).", "date": null, "linkUrl": null, "source": null, "text": null, "timecode": "03:11", "title": null, "category": "note"}]}}}, "commentsEnabled": false, "commentsLoggedInOnly": false}, "language": "en", "messages": {}, "responseCode": 200, "__N_SSP": true}
