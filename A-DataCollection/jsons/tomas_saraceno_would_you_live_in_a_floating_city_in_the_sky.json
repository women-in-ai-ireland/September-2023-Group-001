To do so, it draws on archival material associated with Commander Malcolm D.\r\nRoss who, during the 1950s and early 1960s, spent more time than any other person in the\r\nstratosphere. Coupling accounts of Ross\u2019s experimental ascents with his interest in creative writing and communication, this article uses three unopened envelopes carried by Ross into the stratosphere as a point of departure for layering together three strands of thinking. The first is a consideration of the stratosphere as a zone of exchange, experiment, and experience. The second is a reflection on the envelope as a spatiotemporal form, a limit, and a lure for thinking. The third is a discussion of the modes of atmospheric sensing made possible by stratospheric flights. These strands are worked together to develop a distinctive speculative mode of atmospheric address. Such modes of address can contribute to wider efforts across the geo-humanities to account for the differentiated materiality and movement of the earth\u2019s atmosphere", "eyebrow": "", "headline": "Stratospheric Envelopes for an Atmospheric Mode of Address", "isPdf": false, "label": "READ_ARTICLE", "linkUrl": "http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/2373566X.2017.1301214?journalCode=rgeo20&", "note": "Dereck P.

Our argument is developed via participatory engagement with the work of contemporary artist and architect Tom\u00e1s Saraceno, central to which is the ongoing attempt to craft aesthetic works that mobilize the elemental energy of the sun to generate novel modes of sensing, traveling, and living in the air. Drawing on participatory research and engagement with Saraceno's Aerocene project, we show how his work helps us re-imagine distributions of the capacity to sense the elemental.
